# Microsoft Edge supported Operating Systems

This article describes the supported operating systems that apply to Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge for Business. Microsoft Edge follows the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern) and is supported on these operating systems.

## Supported Operating Systems for Microsoft Edge

> [!NOTE]
> Product functionality and feature availability may vary on older operating systems. To ensure that Microsoft Edge installs correctly, use the latest version of any operating system specified below. This guidance includes the latest cumulative update, as applicable.

### Windows Client

- Windows 10 SAC 1709 and later **
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSC

> [!NOTE]
> In version 128, Microsoft Edge will stop supporting CPUs that lack SSE3. Devices with these CPUs will not receive any more updates.

### Windows Server

- Windows Server 2016 (LTSC)
- Windows Server 2019 (LTSC)
- Windows Server 2022 (LTSC)
- Windows Server (SAC)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ** For Windows 10 SAC releases that are out of support but Microsoft Edge is supported it is recommended to upgrade to a supported Win10 SAC release as soon as possible to remain secure. Microsoft Edge being supported in this state should be considered a temporary bridge to getting to a supported OS state.
