# Archived release notes for Microsoft Edge Beta Channel

These release notes provide information about new features and non-security updates that are included in the Microsoft Edge Beta Channel. To understand Microsoft Edge channels, see the [Overview of the Microsoft Edge channels](microsoft-edge-channels.md). All the security updates are listed [here](microsoft-edge-relnotes-security.md).


## Version 130.0.2849.52: October 23, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

## Version 130.0.2849.46: October 17, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

## Version 130.0.2849.43: October 16, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

### Announcements

- **Cancel dialog for beforeunload event.** Microsoft Edge is changing the behavior of the cancel dialog for the `beforeunload` event in Microsoft Edge version 131. Starting in version 131, calling `event.preventDefault` in a `beforeunload` event handler won't prevent the dialog from being shown. Instead, `event.returnValue = ''` needs to be called in the `beforeunload` event handler to prevent the cancel dialog. The [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies?branch=main&branchFallbackFrom=pr-en-us-4867#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) policy is being obsoleted and will no longer work after Microsoft Edge version 130.

## Version 130.0.2849.35: October 11, 2024

Fixed various bugs and performance issues, feature updates, and policy updates.

### Feature updates

- **Copilot browser Context Policies.** The [EdgeEntraCopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgeentracopilotpagecontext) policy will be available starting from Microsoft Edge version 130 and will replace the [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) policy. The [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) policy is deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 130 and will be obsolete in Microsoft Edge 133.

### Policy updates

#### New policies

- [EdgeEntraCopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgeentracopilotpagecontext) - Control access to page content for Entra ID Profiles accessing Microsoft Copilot with Enterprise Data Protection (EDP) from the Microsoft Edge sidebar.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. These notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2808.0 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2808-0-is-live/m-p/4237117)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2821.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2821-1-is-live/m-p/4242634)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2835.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2835-2-is-live/m-p/4250520)
- [Dev Channel update to 130.0.2849.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-130-0-2849-1-is-live/m-p/4255515)

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented the briefcase icon from appearing on the *edge://settings/sidebar* page when Edge Bar was disabled using the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy.  

### Announcement

- **Live Captions.** The [LiveCaptionsAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#livecaptionsallowed) policy was available since Microsoft Edge version 103 but this feature isn't generally available. Clients that have the [ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#experimentationandconfigurationservicecontrol) policy set to 'FullMode' might receive the feature before broad availability. Broad availability will be announced via Microsoft Edge release notes.

### Feature updates

- **Token Binding.** Token Binding uses cryptographic certificates on both ends of the TLS connection in an attempt to close the security gap of bearer tokens, which may be lost or stolen. Token Binding is deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 130. Also, the [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy is now obsolete.

- **Edge on macOS now seamlessly opens links in Teams.** When you set the default browser to Microsoft Edge on macOS and enable the feature, web links from the Teams desktop app are sent via chats, channels, calendar, and other entry points. These links seamlessly open automatically in the profile signed into Teams app and skips the need to reauthenticate in the browser. This feature makes it faster and easier to access content. Administrators can control the availability of this feature using the "Choose Which Browser Opens Web Links" Microsoft 365 policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Elevating top settings and improving settings page navigability.** To make finding browser settings more efficient, Microsoft Edge is introducing three navigation improvements to Edge Settings. We arenâ€™t changing the functionality of any setting, and all the settings stay on the same page as they're today but will be behind clickable sections. These changes are as follows.

  - Introduce quick access to the most used Settings actions on the first place users land when entering Edge Settings (the Profiles page). Clicking the button with the name of the setting navigates users directly to its location.

  - Make densely populated Settings pages (such as *Privacy, search, and services*, *Appearance*, *Cookies and site permissions*, *System and performance*) easier to navigate by introducing quick access to the most used actions located on that page. Clicking the button with the name of the setting takes users directly to its location.

  - For these densely populated pages, each lengthy section of settings will be a clickable "table of contents" with descriptive subtexts. This helps users locate settings directly and avoid unnecessary scrolling.

  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **CSS Container Queries flat tree lookup.** The specification for container queries changed to look up flat tree ancestors. This change is only relevant for shadow DOM where an element will now be able to see non-named containers inside shadow trees into which the element or one of its ancestors is slotted, even if the CSS rule doesn't use `::part()` or `::slotted()`.

- **CSS Nesting: The nested declarations rule.** Keeps bare declarations following a nested rule in their place, by wrapping those declarations in `CSSNestedDeclarations` rules during parsing.

- **Full and unprefixed box-decoration-break support.** Adds support for `box-decoration-break:clone` both for inline fragmentation (line layout) and block fragmentation (pagination for printing and multicol).

  Previously, only `box-decoration-break:slice` (the initial value) was supported for block fragmentation, whereas for inline fragmentation, `box-decoration-break:clone` was also supported, but only when using the `prefixed -webkit-box-decoration-break` property.

- **Allow more pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes after ::part().** CSS selectors that use the `::part()` pseudo-element are allowed to have other CSS pseudo-elements (except `::part()`) and many types of other CSS pseudo-classes after them. Combinators are still not allowed after `::part()`, and pseudo-classes that depend on tree structure aren't allowed.

  Previously only a limited set of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements after `::part()` was allowed. This change allows all of the pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that should be allowed. It means selectors such as `::part(part-name):enabled` and `::part(part-name)::marker` are now allowed.

- **Compression dictionary transport with shared Brotli and shared Zstandard.** This feature adds support for using designated previous responses, as an external dictionary for content encoding compressing responses with Brotli or Zstandard.

  Enterprises might experience potential compatibility issues with enterprise network infrastructure that intercepts HTTPS traffic and is sensitive to unknown content encodings. The enterprise policy [CompressionDictionaryTransportEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#compressiondictionarytransportenabled) is available to turn off the compression dictionary transport feature.

- **Concurrent smooth scrollIntoView().** The [scrollIntoView()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) method with behavior: "smooth" lets developers create scroll containers that scroll to their descendants with a gentle scroll animation. This feature fixes the implementation of the API so that ongoing scrollIntoView animations aren't canceled by unrelated scrolls on other scroll containers.

  The feature also fixes cases where Edge fails to scroll to a page's fragment anchor because of a competing scrollIntoView that is invoked when the page loads.

- **Document picture-in-picture: add option to ignore window bounds cache.** This change adds a new parameter (`preferInitialWindowPlacement`) to the document picture-in-picture API that, when set to true, hints to the user agent that it shouldn't try to reuse the position or size of the previous document picture-in-picture from this site when opening this one.

  Often, a document picture-in-picture window closes and reopens multiple times for the same site, such as moving a video conference to and from PiP. The user agent is free to reopen the PiP window at its most recent size and location, so that it stays where the user last moved it and provides continuity between the PiP windows. However, if the new window is semantically unrelated to the previous window, such as if it's a new video call, then the developer can use this parameter to provide a hint to the user agent that this window might be better opened in its default position and size instead.

- **Improved error reporting in IndexedDB for large value read failures.** Change to reporting for certain error cases that were previously reported with a DOMException and the message "Failed to read large IndexedDB value."

  Now a DOMException is raised with the name "NotFoundError" when the file containing the data being read by an IDBRequest is missing from the disk so that sites can take the appropriate corrective action when an unrecoverable failure occurs. Corrective actions could include deleting the entry from the DB, notifying the user, or re-fetching the data from servers.

- **Keyboard focusable scroll containers.** This feature makes scrollers without focusable children keyboard-focusable by default.

  This is an important improvement to help make scrollers and contents within scrollers more accessible to all users. Keyboard focusable scrollers are enabled by default starting in version 130.

  If more time is needed to implement this feature, the [KeyboardFocusableScrollersEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#keyboardfocusablescrollersenabled) policy is available starting with Edge 128.

- **Support non-special scheme URLs.** Previously, the URL parser didn't support nonspecial URLs. The parser parses nonspecial URLs as if they had an "opaque path," which isn't aligned with the URL Standard. Now, the URL parser parses nonspecial URLs correctly, following the URL Standard.

  See [bit.ly/url-non-special](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LjxHl32fE4tCKugrK_PIso7mfXQVEeoD1wSnX2y0ZU8/edit?resourcekey=0-d1gP4X2sG7GPl9mlTeptIA#heading=h.voahsyj6c2dh) for more details.

- **WebAssembly JavaScript String Builtins.** This feature exposes common JavaScript string operations for import into WebAssembly. This lets you create and manipulate JavaScript strings from WebAssembly without support within WebAssembly. This still allows for a similar performance as supported string references.

- **WebGPU: Dual source blending.** Adds the optional GPU feature "dual-source-blending" that enables combining two fragment shader outputs into a single framebuffer. This technique is useful for applications that require complex blending operations, such as those based on Porter-Duff blend modes. By reducing the need for frequent pipeline state object changes, dual source blending can enhance performance and flexibility.

- **Web Serial: connected attribute and RFCOMM connection events.** This feature adds a boolean `SerialPort.connected` attribute. The attribute returns true if the serial port is logically connected. For wired serial ports, a port is logically connected if the port is physically attached to the system. For wireless serial ports, a port is logically connected if the device hosting the port has any open connections to the host.

  Previously, only wired serial ports dispatched connect and disconnect events. With this feature, Bluetooth RFCOMM serial ports dispatch these events when the port becomes logically connected or disconnected.

  This feature is intended to allow applications to detect when a Bluetooth RFCOMM serial port is available without opening the port.

- **Remove expectedImprovement in DelegatedInkTrailPresenter.** The expectedImprovement attribute tells web developers how much improvement the DelegatedInkTrails API will provide to their current ink latency. However, this attribute isn't worth the increase to fingerprinting entropy.

- **Deprecate non-standard GPUAdapter requestAdapterInfo() method.** The `requestAdapterInfo()` asynchronous method in WebGPU is redundant because developers can already get GPUAdapterInfo synchronously using the GPUAdapter info attribute.

### Policy updates

#### Obsoleted policies

- [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) - Configure the list of sites for which Microsoft Edge will attempt to establish a Token Binding with (obsolete).

These policies support wildcards (*) in URL patterns when being configured: [ImagesAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imagesallowedforurls), [ImagesBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imagesblockedforurls), [InsecureContentAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentallowedforurls), [InsecureContentBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentblockedforurls), [PopupsAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#popupsallowedforurls), [PopupsBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#popupsblockedforurls).

### Feature updates

- **Update to Microsoft Edge supported operating systems.** The minimum supported macOS version is increased to macOS 11. Users on older versions of macOS will no longer receive Microsoft Edge updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Deprecation of the CryptoWallet feature.** To improve end user experience, the CryptoWallet feature and the [CryptoWalletEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cryptowalletenabled) policy is deprecated. The [CryptoWalletEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cryptowalletenabled) policy will be obsolete in an upcoming release.

- **Microsoft Edge sidebar updates.** For inactive sidebar users and new Microsoft Edge users, the sidebar is turned OFF. Users can always return to the **Settings** > **Sidebar** and turn the sidebar ON again at any time. For active sidebar users, the current sidebar state remains the same.
  
  Administrators can control the availability of the sidebar using the [HubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#hubssidebarenabled) policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Feature updates

- **Edge Bar improvements.** Microsoft Edge Bar, the detachable version of the Edge sidebar in Windows 10, has a changed entry point from the gear icon at the bottom of the Edge sidebar's fly out menu to the *edge://settings/sidebar* page.  

  For Windows 11 and Windows 10 users, clicking the gear icon now automatically opens the *edge://settings/sidebar* page.

  Also, the ability for Edge Bar to start automatically when starting a Windows 10 device is enabled again, the Close "X" icon was moved below the ellipsis menu at the bottom right corner of Edge Bar, and Copilot in Edge remains within the browser not in Edge Bar. **Note:** These features are a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see these features, check back as we continue our rollout.

  Disabling Edge Bar through the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy continues to work, there's a fix to make the UI and briefcase icon appear on the *edge://settings/sidebar* page coming soon.

## Version 128.0.2739.33: August 19, 2024

### Feature updates

- **SSE3 Requirement.** Microsoft Edge stopped supporting CPUs that lack SSE3. Devices with such CPUs won't receive any more updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Copilot browser Context Policies.** The [DiscoverPageContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#discoverpagecontextenabled) policy is obsoleted in Edge version 128 and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 127.

  To summarize and answer questions based on browser context in Microsoft Edge, Copilot needs to be able to access the browser context. We're providing two new policies to offer more flexibility for admins to customize Edge browser context access across Copilot chats in Edge sidebar.

  - [CopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotpagecontext) - Control Copilot access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.
  - [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) - Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.

- **Deprecation of the followable web feature.** To improve end user experience, the followable web feature is deprecated. The [EdgeFollowEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgefollowenabled) policy is also obsolete.

- **EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled policy obsoletion.** The [EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enforcelocalanchorconstraintsenabled) policy was previously deprecated and is now obsolete in Edge version 128. Since Microsoft Edge 112, constraints in certificates loaded from the platform certificate store are enforced. The [EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enforcelocalanchorconstraintsenabled) policy existed as a temporary opt-out in case an enterprise encountered issues with the constraints encoded in their private roots.

- **New Policy for Insecure Downloads over HTTP.** Users that download potentially dangerous content on HTTP sites will receive a UI warning in a future Microsoft Edge version. To prepare for this change, the [ShowDownloadsInsecureWarningsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#showdownloadsinsecurewarningsenabled) policy is now available for admins to enable or disable the warnings related to insecure downloads.

- **Get the latest updates effortlessly with instant update.** Instant update in Microsoft Edge ensures you get the latest browser updates automatically, when you step away from your computer. So you can just keep browsing, knowing you already have the latest updates to keep you safe online. For more information, see [Get instant updates in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/get-instant-updates-in-microsoft-edge-4820adad-dd32-470c-9bd9-dba1de71a7f1). **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout to consumer customers. A release to enterprise users is TBD. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

**Announcement**

- **SSE3 Requirement.**  Microsoft Edge will stop supporting CPUs that lack SSE3 in Microsoft Edge 128. Devices with such CPUs won't receive any more updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Token Binding.** Token Binding uses cryptographic certificates on both ends of the TLS connection in an attempt to close the security gap of bearer tokens, which might be lost or stolen. We're planning to deprecate Token Binding in Microsoft Edge version 130. The [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy is deprecated and will be obsoleted in Microsoft Edge version 130.  

### Feature updates

- **Removal of mutation events.** Support for mutation events was removed. The [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) API can be used instead. Administrators can use the [MutationEventsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#mutationeventsenabled) policy as a temporary workaround. Enterprises should still work to remove their dependencies on these mutation events. For more information, see [Intent to Ship: Deprecate Mutation Events (google.com)](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/jBEISy1p1XU).  

- **Gift Card Redemption History in the Hub.** Users with an MSA or Microsoft Entra ID Linked Account can view and utilize information from gift card redemptions through Pay with Rewards or the Rewards Dashboard. Once a user successfully redeems a gift card with Pay with Rewards, information relating to their gift card (date, card number/pin, redemption status) redemption is added to a Redemption History. This information is located in the Wallet hub. Admins can control availability of this feature using the [EdgeWalletCheckoutEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgewalletcheckoutenabled) policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Password Monitor policy update.** When the [PasswordMonitorAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordmonitorallowed) policy is enabled as mandatory, users won't see the consent screen to turn on the feature. Also, when it's set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will be disabled but remain in the 'On' state, and a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "This setting is managed by your organization."

### Policy updates

#### Deprecated policies

- [SignInCtaOnNtpEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#signinctaonntpenabled) - Enable sign in click to action dialog (deprecated).  

#### Obsoleted policies

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 125.0.2492.1 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-125-0-2492-1-is-live/m-p/4103542)

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Defender Application Guard extension deprecation.** Because Application Guard is deprecated, there won't be a migration to Edge Manifest V3. The corresponding extensions and associated [Windows Store app](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8gnlc8z9c8?hl=en-us&gl=US) will not be available after May 2024. This affects the following browsers: [Application Guard Extension - Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/application-guard-extensi/mfjnknhkkiafjajicegabkbimfhplplj) and [Application Guard Extension - Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/category/privacy-security/). If you want to block unprotected browsers until you're ready to retire MDAG usage in your enterprise, we recommend using AppLocker policies or [Microsoft Edge management service](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-management-service). For more information, see [Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard), [Deprecated features in the Windows client - What's new in Windows](/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features), and [Microsoft Defender Application Guard - Windows Security](/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview).

- **Auto-discarding Sleeping Tabs.** Tabs that have been sleeping for a long time are discarded to save memory. When a user navigates back to a discarded tab, the tab needs to be reloaded. This can be managed through the [AutoDiscardSleepingTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autodiscardsleepingtabsenabled) policy. This policy is enabled if the [SleepingTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#sleepingtabsenabled) policy is enabled. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **New Workspaces color display: browser window outline.** Workspaces each have a dedicated color, and that color is now displayed as an outline on the browser window. The previous experience applied the color across the entire tab strip in horizontal tab orientation, and across the title bar in vertical tab orientation. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Full Favorites Bar available in Workspaces.** Workspaces now display a user's full set of favorites in the Favorites Bar, with a dedicated workspace folder accessible from the bar. The previous experience replaced the Favorites Bar with the workspace favorites folder. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Policy updates

#### New policies

- [ZstdContentEncodingEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#zstdcontentencodingenabled) - Enable zstd content encoding support
- [QRCodeGeneratorEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#qrcodegeneratorenabled) - Enable QR Code Generators

From now on, Microsoft Edge gives you the relevant query history suggestions that you used for previous searches, regardless of where you did it. You can always trust Microsoft Edge to help you quickly refind the information that you accessed before.

- **Enterprise secure AI controls in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service now provides a new dedicated space for admins to manage all AI-related policies in the Microsoft Edge browser. This control helps enhance security and productivity for managed users and devices.

### Dev Channel updates

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Beta channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2438.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2438-2-is-live/m-p/4079136)
- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2450.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2450-2-is-live/m-p/4085888)
- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2464.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2464-2-is-live/m-p/4092459)
- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2478.6 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2478-6-is-live/m-p/4097816)

### Feature updates

- **Email notifications for extension requests in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service provides admins with the ability to receive email notifications for extensions that their users requested. These notifications help inform them promptly of any new feedback. **Note:** This experience is in public preview and can be accessed by opting in to targeted release in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Updated default profile pill for EDU users in Edge for Business.** To improve the applicability of the current Edge for Business default visuals, users signed in with an EDU account will see the default profile pill label updated to "School".

- **Desktop Shortcut for New Enterprise Devices.** New Microsoft Enterprise devices running through Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE) for the first time will see a Microsoft Edge desktop shortcut automatically created. This desktop shortcut provides users with an alternative way to access their Microsoft Edge browser without needing to manually pin and configure their set-up.

- **Updated profile options in new profile experience.** Many users unintentionally create empty profiles, cluttering their workspace and impeding their browsing experience. To reduce clutter and the likelihood of profile churn, updated First Run Experience (FRE) string options encourage users to sign-in and meaningfully create profiles for an improved browsing experience, or easily cancel unintentional creation. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Copilot Page Context Policies.** To summarize and answer questions based on page context in Microsoft Edge, Copilot needs to be able to access the page content. We're providing two new policies to offer more flexibility for admins to customize Edge page context access across Copilot chats in Edge sidebar.
   - [CopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotpagecontext) - Control Copilot access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles
   - [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) - Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles
   - The [DiscoverPageContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#discoverpagecontextenabled) policy is deprecated in Edge version 124 and is planned for obsoletion in Microsoft Edge version 127.

- **Inline Compose.** This feature allows users to rewrite text using Copilot. Users can highlight text they'd like to improve and use the Rewrite tool to iterate with different lengths, formats, and tones. Administrators can control availability using the [ComposeInlineEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#composeinlineenabled) policy.

- **Updates to Settings pages on privacy, security, search, & services.**  To improve ease of use, we're updating Edge settings page into two sections: "Privacy and Security" and "Search and Services." This streamlined approach should enable users to find the settings they're interested in more easily. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Removal of Web SQL.** Web SQL support is fully removed. In prior releases, Web SQL support was disabled by default but could be re-enabled via the [WebSQLAccess policy](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies?branch=pr-en-us-4033#websqlaccess). After this change, there's no longer any mechanism to enable Web SQL support. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, see [Intent to Deprecate and Remove Web SQL](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/fWYb6evVA-w/m/pziWcvboAgAJ).

- **Sidebar Tools App - SpeedTest.** Adding a SpeedTest answer by default to the Tools app in the Microsoft Edge sidebar. For more information, see [Manage the sidebar in Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-sidebar).

- **Updated Edge Profile account re-authentication popup when Browser to Web Single-Sign-On (SSO) fails.** Microsoft Edge provides a browser to Web single sign-on (SSO) capability that lets a user sign in to their Edge Profile with a web account first and then automatically sign them into Microsoft first party websites.

  This reauthentication is done by saving cached credentials. This approach works until there's an authentication challenge to the cached credentials. A typical scenario is when a user changes their password on a different device. The cached credentials on the current device become outdated and SSO fails. Edge detects this failure and shows a reauthentication popup that asks the user to update their cached credentials on the current device.

- **Updated profile management and customization controls.** Enhancing the profile management and customization experience through surfaced profile controls and an expanded range of default avatars. With these updates, users can effortlessly tailor their profiles to their preferences and select from a broader collection of profile avatars.

- **Updated UX for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint blocks.** Microsoft Edge now provides a different blocking experience for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint based blocks (Web Content Filtering and Custom Indicators). For more information, see [Web protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/web-protection-overview?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Feature updates

- **RendererAppContainer.** For extra security benefits, the Windows native app container is enabled by default. **Note:** If Enterprise organizations identify a compatibility issue due to code injection from security software, they should follow up with the software publisher directly. Alternatively, they can use the [RendererAppContainerEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#rendererappcontainerenabled) policy to trade off the security benefits in Microsoft Edge with their other software.

- **Updated SmartActionsBlockList Policy.**  The [SmartActionsBlockList](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#smartactionsblocklist) policy is updated with new policy option mappings.  Administrators can now configure the policy to control Smart actions like definitions on websites (smart_actions_website) or control Smart actions in pdfs and on websites (smart_actions).

- **Microsoft Edge Workspaces improvements for offline functionality.**  Any workspace opened on a device previously is cached locally and can be opened on that device from that cache even if it fails to connect. Changes persist on that device and are resolved into the synced version when a connection can finally be made. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Feature updates

- **Behavioral changes to the `beforeunload` event.** The behavior of the `beforeunload` event has changed. Calling `preventDefault` in a `beforeunload` event handler triggers a confirmation dialog. Setting `returnValue` to an empty string in a `beforeunload` event handler no longer triggers a confirmation dialog. This behavior takes effect starting in Microsoft Edge version 119. Administrators can temporarily opt out of this functionality by disabling the [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) policy.

- **Split screen restore improvements.** Split screen allows you to simultaneously work on multiple tasks across two, side-by-side screens in one browsing tab to boost your productivity and multitask more efficiently. Now after the browser is restarted and the previous session is restored, the split tab will also be restored.

- **Additional capability to manage sidebar apps.** Administrators can utilize the "sidebar_auto_open_blocked" [ExtensionSettings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#extensionsettings) policy field to control the auto-open behavior of sidebar apps.  For more information, see [Detailed guide to the ExtensionSettings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide) policy.

- **Updates to Microsoft Edge enterprise sync settings page.** When the [ForceSyncTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#forcesynctypes) and [SyncTypesListDisabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#synctypeslistdisabled) polices are used concurrently, the sync settings page (`edge://settings/profiles/sync`) accurately show the status for each data type.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge for Business Banner.**  Microsoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser across managed and unmanaged devices. The in-product Microsoft Edge for Business banner is being deprecated and will no longer be visible.

- **Find on page.** Searching for a word or phrase on a webpage is easier with the new smart find update to Find on page. For more information, see
[Find on page](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/find-on-page?form=MT00D8). Now when you search with Find on page, we suggest related matches and synonyms making it effortless to find what you're looking for, even if you misspell a word in your search query. When you search, select the suggested word to quickly locate the desired word or phrase on the page. Data is sent to Microsoft for processing.  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge's Privacy Whitepaper](/microsoft-edge/privacy-whitepaper/). Administrators can control the availability using the [RelatedMatchesCloudServiceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#relatedmatchescloudserviceenabled) policy.

- **New SmartScreen policy.**  The [ExemptSmartScreenDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptsmartscreendownloadwarnings) policy lets administrators create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that are exempted from SmartScreen AppRep warnings.  Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy are still subject to file type extension-based security warnings and mixed-content download warnings.

- **New Microsoft Edge Update policies.** The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** and **MeteredUpdates** policies allows administrators to control the "Download Updates over metered connections" setting (`edge://settings/help`). The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** applies to all apps and **MeteredUpdates** applies to targeted apps. When a policy is configured to Allow, updates occur on a metered connection, such as cellular connections or others where data usage is controlled.

### Announcement: Deprecating the unload event

The Google Chrome team plans to deprecate the unload event starting in Chrome version 117. The deprecation is done by gradually changing the default so unload handlers stop firing on pages unless a page explicitly opts in to re-enable them. For more information, see [Deprecating the unload event - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deprecating-unload/), and [Google Groups - Conversations](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/dvusqw9-IhI/m/SBkm_u1RAQAJ).

While we haven't finalized the deprecation schedule, we anticipate that Microsoft Edge  follows Chrome's schedule with a possible delay of a release or two. If you're interested in testing with Microsoft Edge starting in version 118, the **ForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled** policy is available or you can use the instructions documented at [Disable unload handlers by default and add Permissions-Policy to opt-in to enabling them](https://github.com/fergald/docs/blob/master/explainers/permissions-policy-deprecate-unload.md#disable-unload-handlers-by-default-and-add-permissions-policy-to-opt-in-to-enabling-them).

WebView2 supports both the permissions policy and the enterprise policy but won't be impacted by the gradual rollout in Microsoft Edge. We expect WebView2 to switch defaults when the rollout reaches 100% of page loads.

<!-- Version 117.0.2045.9: August 25, 2023 to Version 116.0.1938.36: July 31, 2023 -->

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge for Business update.** Microsoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser across managed and unmanaged devices. The Automatic Switching mechanism is designed to keep work and personal browsing separate for the end users. This mechanism currently switches users from personal to work browsing on applicable logins. The new update automatically starts switching users from work to personal browsing on applicable logins. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge for Business](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business).

- **E-tree in Wallet.** Users signed into Microsoft Edge with a personal Microsoft Account (MSA) can grow a virtual seed into a tree with Wallet. After it finishes growing, a real mangrove is planted.  Administrators can control the availability using the [EdgeWalletEtreeEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edge-wallet-e-tree-enabled) policy. Note: This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Deprecation of features.** To improve end user experience and simplify the More tools menu, the following features are being deprecated: Math Solver, Picture Dictionary, Citations, Grammar Tools, and Kids Mode.

- **Deprecation of Web Select.** To improve end user experience, this feature is being deprecated and will no longer be an option under Web Capture or via keyboard shortcut.

### Feature update

- **Microsoft Edge for Business.** In addition to rich set of enterprise controls, security, and productivity features that you're already familiar with, Microsoft Edge for Business offers new refreshed look and feel, automatic switching to keep your work and personal browsing separate including fixes from private preview feedback, lightly managed Enterprise Personal Browser (MSA profile), and support for Unmanaged BYOPC. Microsoft Edge for Business is now turned on by default.  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge for Business](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business).

- **Locked Tabs in Edge Workspaces.** This feature lets you keep tabs where you put them in an Edge workspace. A locked tab can't be closed, dragged or otherwise moved out of a workspace window. To lock a tab, right-click the tab and choose "Lock Tab" from the context menu.  Click the lock icon on a tab to unlock it. Only the workspace creator and the user who locked the tab are permitted to unlock the tab. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Workspaces](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-workspaces). **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **New Microsoft Edge PDF experience policy for WebView2.** The [NewPDFReaderWebView2List](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-webview-policies#newpdfreaderwebview2list) policy configures WebView2 applications to launch the new version of the PDF reader that's powered by Adobe Acrobat's PDF rendering engine.  The new PDF reader ensures that there's no loss of functionality and delivers an enhanced PDF experience. This experience includes richer rendering, improved performance, strong security for PDF file handling, and greater accessibility. Administrators can use the [NewPDFReaderWebView2List](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-webview-policies#newpdfreaderwebview2list) policy or WebView2 developers can explicitly enable the **msPdfSharedLibrary** experimental flag in code to use WebView2 with PDF powered by Adobe PDF Engine.

### Feature update

- **(Preview) Microsoft Edge Workspaces.** Edge Workspaces gives customers a way to organize their browsing tasks into dedicated windows. Edge Workspaces lets users share a set of browser tabs so working groups can view the same websites and latest working files in one place and stay on the same page. Each Edge Workspace contains its own sets of tabs and favorites, created and curated by the user and their collaborators. Edge Workspaces are automatically saved and kept up to date. For more information about this public preview, see [Microsoft Edge Workspaces](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-workspaces).

- **Option to attach the Edge sidebar to the Windows desktop.**  Users of the Microsoft Edge sidebar will be able to access their apps and sites directly from their Windows desktop. As an opt-in experience, users can attach the sidebar to their Windows desktop by clicking a "popout" icon near the base of the sidebar in the browser. This enables a side-by-side experience that works with any Windows appâ€”including Microsoft Edge itself. Users enjoy streamlined access to the same set of powerful AI tools and web-based services, including Bing Chat, without launching a browser window, enhancing productivity regardless of where they are in Windows. Administrators can control the availability using the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled).

For more information, see [Browse more safely with Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-browse-safer).

- **New policy to clear IE mode data on browser exit.** The [InternetExplorerModeClearDataOnExitEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorermodecleardataonexitenabled) policy controls whether browsing history is deleted from Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer mode every time Microsoft Edge is closed.

### Feature update

- **New Immersive Reader policies.**  Immersive Reader in Microsoft Edge simplifies web page layouts, removes clutter, and helps you customize your reading experience.  Administrators can use these new policies ([ImmersiveReaderGrammarToolsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enable-grammar-tools-feature-within-immersive-reader-in-microsoft-edge) and [ImmersiveReaderPictureDictionaryEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enable-picture-dictionary-feature-within-immersive-reader-in-microsoft-edge)), to control the availability of Grammar Tools and Picture Dictionary features within Immersive Reader.

- **Enabling sync for Microsoft Entra ID signed in customers.**  Microsoft Edge sync roams data across all signed in instances of Microsoft Edge. This data includes favorites, passwords, browsing history, open tabs, settings, apps, collections, and extensions.â€¯ For Microsoft Entra users who have sync turned off, after the browser is launched they'll see a notification message and have sync turned on for all signed in instances of Microsoft Edge. This sync enablement includes other devices where they're signed in.  Additionally, if a user's other devices don't have history and open tabs sync on, those two toggles are turned on.â€¯ Organizations using the [SyncDisabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#syncdisabled) policy aren't affected by this change.

- **In-browser JSON viewer.**  Improvements to how JSON files are displayed in the browser include a color-coded tree view with line numbers and the ability to collapse and expand the data.  This functionality triggers automatically when the browser navigates to a JSON file on the web or the user opens a local file.  Additional features and enhancements will roll out when they're available.  For more information and to provide feedback, visit [DevTools: In-browser JSON viewer](https://microsoftedge.github.io/DevTools/explainers/JSONViewer/explainer).

- **Split Screen.** This feature lets you browse faster with side by side tabs. Boost your productivity with two tabs side-by-side in one browser window. With split screen, you can multitask without losing focus.  Users can access Split Screen by clicking the toolbar icon or by selecting "Open link in split window" in the context menu.  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Feature update

- **MSA-AAD Account Linking.** Microsoft is enabling users who have a personal Microsoft account (an MSA) and a Microsoft user account through their work or school (a Microsoft Entra account) to "link" the two types of accounts together. "Linked accounts" means that users are able to see some of the content from their personal account alongside the tailored content from their work or school account. They're also able to earn Microsoft Rewards points in their personal account from their activities while using their work or school account. More blended experiences might be made available.  For more information, see the [Account Linking FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/account-linking-faq-c66effb9-02e6-49c0-89e1-ae4d8644e6f7) and the [Account Linking IT Admins FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/account-linking-it-admins-faq-72f0dc4e-b632-439e-b90c-347043a7b75a). Tenant admins can learn how to control this feature in the Message Center section of the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Also, this feature can be controlled by using the [LinkedAccountEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#linkedaccountenabled) policy.

- **TLS server certificate verification changes.**  In Microsoft Edge version 110, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier are decoupled from the host operating system's root store. Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier are provided by and shipped with the browser.  The [MicrosoftRootStoreEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#microsoftrootstoreenabled) policy is now available for testing to control when the built-in root store and certificate verifier are used.  Support for the policy is planned for removal in Microsoft Edge version 111.  For more information, see [Changes to Microsoft Edge browser TLS server certificate verification](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification).  **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout in Microsoft Edge version 109.  If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

### Feature updates

- **Upcoming three-digit version number in user agent string.** Starting with version 100, Microsoft Edge will send a three-digit version number in the User-Agent header, for example "Edg/100". Starting with Microsoft Edge 97, site owners can test this upcoming agent string by enabling the **#force-major-version-to-100** experiment flag in *edge://flags* to ensure their User-Agent parsing logic is robust and works as expected.

- **Personalize multi-profile experiences with profile preferences for sites.** Users can personalize their multi-profile experience with the ability to create a customized list of sites for automatic profile switching in Microsoft Edge.

- **Bidirectional Cookie Sharing for IE mode.** This feature expands on the cookie sharing capability already available and lets users sync specific session cookies from Internet Explorer/IE mode to Microsoft Edge. For more information, see [Cookie sharing between Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-add-guidance-cookieshare).

- **Navigate PDF documents using page thumbnails.** You will now be able to navigate through your PDF document using thumbnails that represent the pages. These thumbnails will appear in the pane on the left side of the PDF reader.

- **Configure the list of domains for which the password manager User Interface (UI) for Save and Fill will be disabled.** Use the [PasswordManagerBlocklist](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordmanagerblocklist) policy to configure the list of domains (HTTP/HTTPS schemas and hostnames only) where Microsoft Edge should disable the password manager. This means that Save and Fill workflows will be disabled, which ensures that passwords for those websites can't be saved or auto filled into web forms.

- **Update extensions to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store using API's (in public preview).** You can integrate these API's directly into your build pipeline, and publish package updates to the Microsoft Edge Add-on website. To learn more, see [Using the Microsoft Edge Add-ons API (in private preview)](/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/publish/api/using-addons-api)

### Feature updates

- **Enhance your security on the web.** A browsing mode in Microsoft Edge where the security of your browser takes priority, giving you an extra layer of protection when browsing the web. Administrators can apply the following Group Policies to end-user desktops (Windows, macOS, and Linux) to help protect against zero days. These policies also make that important sites and line of business applications continue to work as expected. This feature is a huge step forward because it lets us mitigate unforeseen active zero days (based on historical trends). When turned on, this feature brings Hardware-enforced Stack Protection, Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG), and Content Flow Guard (CFG) as supporting security mitigations to increase users' security on the web.
Group Policies:
  - [EnhanceSecurityMode](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymode)
  - [EnhanceSecurityModeBypassListDomains](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymodebypasslistdomains)
  - [EnhanceSecurityModeEnforceListDomains](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymodeenforcelistdomains)

- **Custom primary password.** The browser already has the capability where users can add an authentication step before saved passwords are auto-filled in web forms. This adds another layer of privacy and helps prevent unauthorized users from using saved passwords to log on websites. Custom primary password is an evolution of that same feature, where users will now be able to use a custom string of their choice as their primary password. After it's enabled, users will enter this password to authenticate themselves and have their saved passwords auto filled into web forms.

- **Overlay scrollbars added to Microsoft Edge.** We've updated our scrollbars with an overlay-based design. Users can turn this feature on in *edge://flags*.

### Feature updates

- **Use current profile to sign into websites when multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device.** When multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device, users are asked to choose an account from the account picker to continue their visits to websites. In this release, users are prompted to allow Microsoft Edge to sign in to the websites automatically with the work and school account that's signed into current profile. Users can turn this feature on and off in **Settings/Profile preferences**.

- **Add support for Microsoft Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) on macOS.** Microsoft Endpoint DLP policy enforcement is available natively on macOS.

- **Open digitally signed PDF files.**  Digital signatures are used extensively to validate the authenticity of, and changes to, a document. Users can validate the signatures for PDF files directly from the browser, without the need for any add-ins.

- **Citations in Microsoft Edge.** Citing sources for research is a common requirement for students. They have to manage many research references and sources, which aren't easy tasks. They also have to translate these citations to proper citation formats like APA, MLA, and Chicago. This new "Citations" feature in Microsoft Edge (now in Preview) gives students a better way to manage and generate citations as they research online. With Citations turned on in Collections or from **Settings and more (Alt-F)**, Microsoft Edge automatically generates citations that students can use later so they can stay focused on their research. When they're done, they can easily compile these citations into a final deliverable. For more information, see [Previewing Citations in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/11/04/preview-citations-feature-edge/).

### Feature updates

- **Launch Progressive Web App (PWA) directly via protocol links.** Let installed PWAs handle links that use a specific protocol for a more integrated experience.

- **Learn how to solve math problems with Math Solver.** We're excited to announce that you can use Math Solver in Microsoft Edge to get help with a wide range of mathematical concepts. These concepts range from elementary arithmetic and quadratic equations to trigonometry and calculus. Math Solver lets you take a picture of a handwritten or printed math problem and then provides an instant solution with step-by-step instructions to help you learn how to reach the solution without help. Math Solver also comes with a mathematical keyboard that you can use to easily type math problems. This keyboard eliminates the need to search around a traditional keyboard to find the math characters you need. After solving your problem, Math Solver provides options to continue learning with quizzes, worksheets, and video tutorials.

- **Freeform highlighting on PDFs.** The PDF viewing and markup experience are improved with the addition of freeform highlighters. You can highlight sections in PDFs that you don't have access to, and scanned documents.

- **Hardware-enforced Stack Protection.**  Microsoft Edge begins supporting an even safer browsing mode that uses hardware-dependent control flow for browser processes on supported hardware (Intel 11th Gen. or AMD Zen 3). Note: Because this is a Controlled Feature Rollout, you might not notice this feature enabled on all devices. You can enable or disable Hardware-enforced Stack Protection by manipulating Image File Execution Options (IFEO) using group policy.

- **New warning dialog for typosquatting sites.** The browser will now show a warning on some sites with URLs that look similar to other sites. This UI uses client-side heuristics to warn users about sites that might be spoofing popular web sites. For more information, see [What is typosquatting?](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-typosquatting-54a18872-8459-4d47-b3e3-d84d9a362eb0).

- **Improved handoff between IE mode and the modern browser.**  Starting with this version of Microsoft Edge, navigation between Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer mode includes form data and extra HTTP headers. Referrer headers, post data, forms data, and request methods are forwarded correctly across the two experiences. You can specify which data types should be included using the [InternetExplorerIntegrationComplexNavDataTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationcomplexnavdatatypes) policy. For more information, see this FAQ: [My application requires transferring POST data between IE mode and Microsoft Edge](./edge-ie-mode-faq.md#my-application-requires-transferring-post-data-between-ie-mode-and-microsoft-edge-is-this-supported).

- **Cloud Site List Management for IE mode in Public Preview.**  Cloud Site List Management lets you manage your site lists for IE mode in the cloud without needing an on-premises infrastructure to host your organization's site list. You can access the Cloud Site List Management feature using the Microsoft Edge Site Lists experience in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. To learn more, see the [Cloud Site List Management for IE mode (Public Preview)](./edge-ie-mode-cloud-site-list-mgmt.md) article.

- **Update Microsoft Edge WebWiew2 using WSUS.** IT Admins using WSUS to update Microsoft Edge will also be able to update Microsoft Edge WebView2 using WSUS. This capability gives admins an easier servicing process for offline devices.

- **WSUS updates for Server.** WSUS and Catalog updates for Microsoft Edge channels (Stable, Beta, Dev) will now apply to Windows Server SKUs that have Microsoft Edge installed, including Windows Server 2022. For more information on how to configure WSUS updates for Microsoft Edge, see [Update Microsoft Edge](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/deploy-edge?bc=%2FDeployEdge%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&toc=%2FDeployEdge%2Ftoc.json#update-microsoft-edge).

### Feature updates

- **View in File Explorer support for SharePoint Online libraries in Microsoft Edge.**  Now you can enable the View in File Explorer capability for SharePoint Online Modern Document Libraries. For this experience to be visible and work for your users, you'll need to enable the Microsoft Edge ["Configure the View in File Explorer feature for SharePoint pages in Microsoft Edge"](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#configureviewinfileexplorer) policy and update your SharePoint Online tenant configuration. Learn more: [View SharePoint files with File Explorer in Microsoft Edge - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Docs](/SharePoint/sharepoint-view-in-edge).

- **Intranet zone file URL links will open in Windows File Explorer.**  You can allow file URL links to intranet zone files originating from intranet zone HTTPS websites to open Windows File Explorer for that file or directory. You can enable this experience using the [IntranetFileLinksEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#intranetfilelinksenabled) policy.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge moving to a 4-week cadence for updates in Beta and Stable channels.**  We'll adopt a new, 4-week release cycle for major versions. You can read more about the decision here: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/12/new-release-cycles-microsoft-edge-extended-stable/

- **New Extended stable option being offered.**  We're offering a new Extended Stable option to our managed Enterprise customers. The Extended Stable option stays on even numbered revisions and update every eight weeks. There is a biweekly security update.  Additional information here: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/07/15/opt-in-extended-stable-release-cycle/

- **Improvements to default behavior of opening MHTML files.**  MHTML files continue to open in IE mode if IE mode is enabled, unless the MHTML file was saved from Microsoft Edge (using the Save As or Save Page As options in Microsoft Edge). If the file was saved from Microsoft Edge, it now opens in Microsoft Edge.  This change fixes a rendering issue that was observed when opening an MHTML file in IE mode when saved from Microsoft Edge.

- **Restrict private network requests to secure contexts.** Access to resources on local (intranet) networks from pages on the internet requires that those pages be delivered over HTTPS. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5436853517811712). Two compatibility policies are available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with nonsecure pages: [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecureprivatenetworkrequestsallowed) and [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecureprivatenetworkrequestsallowedforurls).

- **Block mixed content downloads.** Secure pages only download files hosted on other secure pages, and downloads hosted on nonsecure (non-HTTPS) pages are blocked if initiated from a secure page. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Google security blog entry](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/02/protecting-users-from-insecure_6.html).

- **Enable implicit sign-in for on-premises accounts.**   By enabling the OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled policy, only on-premises accounts are enabled for implicit sign-in.  Microsoft Edge doesn't attempt to implicitly sign in to MSA or Microsoft Entra accounts. Upgrade from on-premises accounts to Microsoft Entra accounts are stopped as well.

- **Free form text boxes added to PDF documents.**  We now support adding free form text boxes to PDF documents that you can use to fill in forms and add visible notes.

- **Update your passwords with ease.**  The browser will now take you directly to the Change Password page for a given website saving you time and mouse clicks by avoiding the need to navigate to the page manually. Once you're on this page the browser also autofills your existing password and suggest a strong, unique new password. Note: Currently this feature is available on a limited number of sites.  

- **New accessibility settings page.** We brought accessibility-related settings together on a single page. You can find the new edge://settings/accessibility page under the main settings list. Here you can find settings to make the web page bigger, show a high visibility outline around the area of focus and other settings that can help improve your web browsing experience.

### Feature updates

- **Initial Preferences in Microsoft Edge.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, deploying Microsoft Edge to your enterprise becomes easier with the addition of [Initial Preferences](/deployedge/initial-preferences-support-on-microsoft-edge-browser).

- **IE mode on Microsoft Edge will support "no-merge" behavior.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, IE mode on Microsoft Edge supports "no-merge". For an end user, when a new browser window is launched from an IE mode application, it is in a separate session, similar to the behavior in IE11. You'll need to adjust your site list to configure sites that need to prevent session sharing. Behind the scenes, for each window of Microsoft Edge, the first time an IE mode tab is visited within that window, if it is one of the designated "no-merge" sites, that window is locked into a different "no-merge" IE session from all other Microsoft Edge windows at least until the last IE mode tab is closed in that window. Learn more [here](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-faq#does-ie-mode-on-microsoft-edge-support-the--no-merge--option-that-was-supported-in-internet-explorer-11-).

- **Tab Groups.**  The ability to categorize tabs into user-defined groups helps you more effectively find, switch, and manage tabs across multiple workstreams. To enable this, we're turning on tab grouping beginning with Microsoft Edge version 93.

- **Hide the title bar while using Vertical Tabs.**  Get the extra few pixels back by hiding the browser's title bar, while in Vertical Tabs. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, you can go to edge://settings/appearance and under the Customize Toolbar section select the option to hide the title bar while in Vertical Tab mode.

- **Video Picture in Picture (PiP) from hover toolbar.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, it will become even easier to enter Picture in Picture (PiP) mode. When you hover over a supported video, a toolbar appears that allows you to view that video in a PiP window. Note: this is currently available for Microsoft Edge users on macOS. Check back shortly as we continue our rollout to Windows users.

- **Removal of 3DES in TLS.**  Starting with Microsoft Edge version 93, support for the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite will be removed. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6678134168485888). Additionally, in Microsoft Edge version 93, the [TripleDESEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#tripledesenabled) policy is available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with outdated servers. This compatibility policy becomes obsolete and stops working in Microsoft Edge version 95. Ensure that you update affected servers before then.

- **Policies to bypass ClickOnce and DirectInvoke prompts.**  We updated our policies to enable bypassing ClickOnce's prompts and DirectInvoke's app for specified file types, from specified domains. To do this, you'll need to:

  - Enable [ClickOnceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#clickonceenabled) or [DirectInvokeEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#directinvokeenabled)
  - Enable [AutoOpenFileTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoopenfiletypes) policy and set the list of specific file types that ClickOnce and DirectInvoke should be disabled for
  - Enable the [AutoOpenAllowedForURLs](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoopenallowedforurls) policy and set the list of specific domains that ClickOnce and DirectInvoke will be disabled for

  Note: AutoOpenAllowedForURLs is a supporter policy for AutoOpenFileTypes. If AutoOpenAllowedForURLs isn't set and AutoOpenFileTypes is set, then file types listed will automatically open from all URLs.

### New Policies

- [AutoplayAllowlist](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoplayallowlist) Allow media autoplay on specific sites

### Feature updates

- **Natural language search for browser history on the address bar**. Finding the article/website you're looking for is now easier thanks to natural language search right from the address bar. You can find search results based on page content/description/timing (such as "cake recipe from last week") in addition to titles/URL keyword matches alone.
Note: This is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Users can easily get to Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 92, users can reload a site in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of relying on the standalone IE 11 application while waiting for a site to be configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List. Users are prompted to add the site to their local site list such that navigating to the same page in Microsoft Edge will automatically render in IE mode for the next 30 days. You can use the *[InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed)* policy to configure this experience and allow access to the IE mode entry points and the ability to add sites to the local site list. You can use the *[InternetExplorerIntegrationLocalSiteListExpirationDays](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationlocalsitelistexpirationdays)* policy to adjust the number of days to keep sites on the local site list.
KB5003698 or later is required for Windows 10, version 1909; or KB5003690 or later is required for Windows 10, version 2004, Windows 10, version 20H2, or Windows 10, version 21H1 for the end-to-end experience.

- **MHTML files will default to opening in Internet Explorer mode**. Starting in Microsoft Edge version 92 Stable, MHTML file types will automatically open in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of the Internet Explorer (IE11) application. This is most commonly observed while trying to view Outlook emails in a browser. This change occurs only if IE11 is the default handler for this file type. If you'd prefer to change this, you can do so before installing the Stable version 92 update using [this guidance](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationdefaults#applicationdefaults-defaultassociationsconfiguration).

- **Payment instruments are now synced across devices**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you can synchronize your payment information across your signed in devices.
Note: This is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **"Disable developer mode extensions" warning can be permanently dismissed**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you can turn off the warning "Disable developer mode extensions" by clicking on the 'Don't show this again' option.
Please note: this is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Manage your extensions right from the toolbar**. The all-new extensions menu on the toolbar will allow you to hide/pin extensions easily. The quick links to manage extensions and find new extensions will make it easy for you to find new extensions and manage your existing ones. Note: This is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Automatic HTTPS**. Users have the option to upgrade navigation from HTTP to HTTPS on domains likely to support this more secure protocol. This support can also be configured to attempt delivery over HTTPS for all domains. Note: We're experimenting with this feature and this behavior isn't seen if you opted out of experiments.

- **Improvements to font rendering**. Improvements are made to the rendering of text to improve clarity and reduce blurriness.
Note: This is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Microsoft Editor.**Â  Microsoft Editor offers enhanced spell checking, grammar checking, and text predictions.Â [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/microsoft-editor-checks-grammar-and-more-in-documents-mail-and-the-web-91ecbe1b-d021-4e9e-a82e-abc4cd7163d7).

### Feature updates

- **Identify network traffic originating from Microsoft Defender Application Guard containers at the proxy level**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, there's built in support to tag network traffic originating from Application Guard containers, allowing enterprises to identify them and apply specific policies.

- **Support option to allow synchronizing Favorites from the host to the Edge Application Guard container**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, users can configure Application Guard to synchronize their favorites from the host to the container. This ensures new favorites appear on the container as well.

- **Support for Speech Recognition APIs**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, API support for speech recognition commands on Google.com and similar sites are added. This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

- **Personalize your browser with new theme colors**. Make Microsoft Edge your own with one of the fourteen new theme colors on the Settings -> Appearance page. You can also install custom themes from the Microsoft Edge Add-on site. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/make-microsoft-edge-your-own-with-themes/m-p/2083165)

- **Interrupt Downloads** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91 the browser will automatically interrupt downloads of types that could harm your computer if those downloads are started without a user interaction and aren't supported by SmartScreen Application Reputation check. Users can override and continue to download by right clicking and choosing "Keep" on the download item. 
<!---
Enterprise administrators may opt out of this behavior one of these two policies: 

    - [ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings](./deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies.md#exemptdomainfiletypepairsfromfiletypedownloadwarnings) - Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains --->
For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Security downloads interruptions](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions)

## Version 90.0.818.8: March 16

### Feature updates

- **Single Sign On (SSO) is now available for Microsoft Entra accounts and Microsoft Account (MSA) on macOS**. A user signed in on Microsoft Edge on macOS will now get automatically signed into websites that are configured to allow single sign-on with Work and Microsoft accounts (for example, bing.com, office.com, msn.com, and outlook.com).

- **Kiosk mode.** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, we locked down the UI print settings to only allow the configured printers and "Print to PDF" options. We have also done improvements within the assigned access single app kiosk mode to restrict the launch of other applications from the browser. For more information about the kiosk mode features, [see](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode#kiosk-mode-supported-features).

- **Printing:**

  - **New print rasterization mode for non-PostScript printers**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, Admins can use a new policy to define print rasterization mode for their users. This policy  controls how Microsoft Edge prints to non-PostScript printers on Windows. Sometimes print jobs on non-PostScript printers need to be rasterized to print correctly. The print options are Full and Fast.

  - **Additional page scaling options for printing**. Users are now able to customize scaling while printing webpages and PDF documents using more options. The "Fit to Page" option ensures that the webpage or document is fit into the space available in the selected "Paper size" for printing. The "Actual size" option ensures that there are no changes in the size of the contents being printed regardless of the selected "Paper size".

- **Productivity:**

  - **Autofill suggestions are extended to include address fields content from clipboard**. Clipboard content is parsed when you click on a profile/address field (for example, phone, email, zip code, city, state, etc.) to show as autofill suggestions.

  - **Users can search for autofill suggestions even if a form or field isn't detected**. Today if you have your information saved on Microsoft Edge, autofill suggestions pop up automatically and help you save time while filling out forms. In cases where autofill misses a form, or if you want to fetch data in forms that don't typically have autofill (like temporary forms), you can search for your information using autofill.

- **Access downloads from a flyout in the menu bar**. Downloads appear in the top-right corner with all the active downloads in one place. This menu is easily dismissible so users can continue browsing uninterrupted, and they can monitor overall download progress right from the toolbar. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-the-new-downloads-experience/m-p/2111551).

### Feature updates

- **Kiosk mode enables additional lockdown capabilities**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, we added more lockdown capabilities within kiosk mode to enable customers to get the job done in a productive and more secure experience. [Learn more](microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode.md#kiosk-mode-supported-features).

- **The Enterprise Mode Site List Manager tool will be available in the browser through the *edge://compat* page**. You can use this tool to create, edit, and export your site list XML for Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge. You can enable access to this tool as needed through group policy. [Learn More](./edge-ie-mode-site-list-manager.md).

- **Improve browser performance with sleeping tabs**. Sleeping tabs improves browser performance by putting inactive tabs to sleep to free up system resources like memory and CPU so active tabs or other applications can use them. Users can prevent sites from going to sleep and configure the length of time before an inactive tab goes to sleep. To keep users in their flow, there are also [heuristics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/sleeping-tabs-faq/m-p/1705434) to prevent certain sites from going to sleep, such as intranet sites. This feature can be managed with group policies.

  > [!NOTE]
  > "Improve browser performance with sleeping tabs" is an update to the February 3 release notes for major version 89.0.774.18.

- **Reset your Microsoft Edge sync data in the cloud manually**. We're introducing a way to reset your Microsoft Edge sync data from within the product. This action ensures that your data is cleared from Microsoft services, and resolving certain product issues that previously required a support ticket.

- **Improvements to text selection experience within PDF documents**. Users begin to get a smoother and more consistent text selection experience across PDF documents opened in Microsoft Edge starting with version 89.

- **Date of birth field now supported in autofill**. Today Microsoft Edge helps you save time and effort while filling out forms and creating accounts online by auto filling your data like addresses, names, phone numbers, etc. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, we're adding support for another field that you can have saved and autofilled - date of birth. You can view, edit, and delete this information anytime in your profile settings.

- **Support for natural language search on the address bar, history search page, and the history hub**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, finding an article/website is easier with the natural language search on the address bar, history page, and history hub. Users can search for previously viewed page content/description/timing (such as "cake recipe from last week") in addition to titles/URL keyword matches. This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

### Feature updates

- **Deprecations:**

  - Deprecate support for FTP protocol. Support for the legacy FTP protocol is removed from Microsoft Edge. Attempting to navigate to an FTP link results in the browser directing the Operating System to open an external application to handle the FTP link. Alternatively, IT administrators can configure Microsoft Edge to use IE Mode for sites that rely on the FTP protocol.
  - Adobe Flash support will be removed. Starting with Microsoft Edge Beta version 88, Adobe Flash capability and support will be removed. Learn more: [Update on Adobe Flash Player End of Support - Microsoft Edge Blog (windows.com)](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/04/update-adobe-flash-end-support/)

- **Authentication:**

  - Single Sign On (SSO) now available for Microsoft Entra accounts and Microsoft Account (MSA) on macOS and down-level Windows. A user signed in on Microsoft Edge on either macOS or down-level Microsoft Windows (7, 8.1) will now get automatically signed into websites that are configured to allow single sign on with Work and Microsoft accounts (for example, bing.com, office.com, msn.com, outlook.com).<br>Note: A user might have to sign out and then sign back in if they'd signed into Microsoft Edge in a version before Microsoft Edge 88 to use this feature.
  - Automatically switch users on macOS to their work profile for sites that authenticate with their work account. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 88, we provide the ability to switch sites that authenticate with a user's work profile on macOS.<br>Note: A user may have to sign out and then sign back in if they'd signed into Microsoft Edge in a version prior to Microsoft Edge 88 to use this feature.

- **Kiosk mode option to end session**. The "End session" button is now available in a kiosk mode public browsing experience. This feature ensures that browser data and settings are deleted when Microsoft Edge is closed. Learn more about kiosk mode features and roadmap, [Configure Microsoft Edge kiosk mode](./microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode.md).

- **Security and Privacy:**

  - Alerts are generated if a user's password is found in an online leak. User passwords are checked against a repository of known-breached credentials. A user gets an alert if a match is found. To ensure security and privacy, user passwords are hashed and encrypted when they're checked against the database of leaked credentials.
  - Automatically upgrade mixed content. Secure pages delivered over HTTPS might contain references images that are served over non-secure HTTP. To improve privacy and security in Microsoft Edge 88, those images will be retrieved over HTTPS instead. If the image isn't available over HTTPS, it will not be loaded.
  - View site permissions by site and by recent activity. Starting with Microsoft Edge 88, users are able to manage site permissions more easily. They'll be able to view permissions by web site rather than just permission type. Additionally, we added a recent activity section that shows a user all the recent changes to their site permissions.
  - Increased controls for browser cookies. Starting with Microsoft Edge 88, users can delete third-party cookies without affecting first party cookies. Users will also be able to filter their cookies by first or third party and sort by name, number of cookies, and the amount of data stored and last modified.

- **Performance:**

  - Improve browser performance with sleeping tabs. Sleeping tabs improves browser performance by putting inactive tabs to sleep to free up system resources like memory and CPU so active tabs or other applications can use them. Users can prevent sites from going to sleep and configure the length of time before an inactive tab goes to sleep. To keep users in their flow, there are also heuristics to prevent certain sites from going to sleep, such as intranet sites. This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who have enabled experimentation. We're planning to have the sleeping tabs feature enabled by default with Microsoft Edge version 89. This feature can be managed with group policies.
  - Improve Microsoft Edge startup speed with startup boost. To improve Microsoft Edge startup speed, we developed a feature named startup boost. Startup boost makes Microsoft Edge launch faster by enabling Microsoft Edge to run in the background. Note: This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who have enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

- **Productivity:**

  - Improve productivity and multi-tasking with vertical tabs. As the number of horizontal tabs grows, site titles start to get cut off and tab controls are lost as each tab shrinks. This interrupts user workflow as they spend more time finding, switching, and managing their tabs and less time on the task at hand. Vertical tabs let users move their tabs to the side, where vertically aligned icons and longer site titles make it easier to quickly scan, identify and switch to the tab they want to open.
  - Auto filling the date of birth field. Microsoft Edge already helps save time and effort while filling out forms and creating accounts online by auto filling user data such as addresses, names, phone numbers, etc. Microsoft Edge now supports the date of birth field which users can save and auto fill. A user can view, edit, and delete this information anytime in their profile settings.
  - Improvements to Recently closed in History. Recently closed now keeps the last 25 tabs and windows from any past browsing session rather than just the previous session. Users can select Recently closed in the new History experience to see all the tabs that were open.
  - "Your day at a glance" feature enabled by default. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 88, information workers can benefit from intelligent productivity features on their New tab page (NTP). We offer users signed in with their work or school account personalized and relevant content powered by their Microsoft 365 Graph. Users can quickly scan their "Your day at a glance" modules to easily track their meetings and recent work and quickly launch the applications they want to use.

- **PDF:**

  - PDF document display in book view (two pages). Starting with Microsoft Edge version 88, users can view PDF documents in a single page or in the two page book view. To change the view, select the **Page View** button in the toolbar.
  - Anchored text notes support for PDF files. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 87, users can add typed text notes on any piece of text in PDF files.
  - Smoother text selection experience in PDF documents. Users get a smoother and consistent text selection experience across PDF documents opened in Microsoft Edge.
  - View webpages saved as PDF files in the Downloads bar. Users can now view the PDF files generated by setting "Save as PDF" as the printer destination for webpages in the Downloads bar.

- **Fonts:**

  - Browser icons are updated to the Fluent design system. As part of our continued work around Fluent Design in the browser, we made changes to closer align icons to the new Microsoft icon system. These changes impact many of our high-touch user interfaces, including tabs, address bar, and navigational and wayfinding icons found in our various menus.
  - Improved font rendering. Text rendering is improved for better clarity and to reduce blurriness.

### Feature updates

- **Kiosk mode privacy features enabled**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 87 kiosk mode features that help enterprises around the privacy of user data will be enabled. These features will enable experiences such as clear the user data on exit, delete downloaded files and to reset the configured start experience after a specified amount of idle time. Learn more about how to [Configure Microsoft Edge kiosk mode](./microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode.md)
- **ClickOnce deployment enabled by default**. ClickOnce is enabled by default in Microsoft Edge 87, which reduces the barriers for enterprises to deploy software and better align with Microsoft Edge Legacy browser behavior. Starting in Microsoft Edge 87, the ClickOnceEnabled policy's "Not configured" state reflects the new default ClickOnce state of Enabled (as compared to the previous default state of Disabled).
- **The enterprise new tab page (NTP) integrates productivity with customizable, work-relevant feed content**. The enterprise NTP blends the Office 365 productivity page we offer to users signed in with their work or school account with personalized, work-relevant company and industry feeds that are organized in a single page. Users are able to recognize the familiar Office 365 content and Microsoft Search for Business powered by Bing. In addition, they can easily flip to a customizable "My Feed" with content and modules that are relevant to the user, their company, or their industry, and a selection of other feeds that the organization made available. [Learn more](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-industry-news?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide).

- **Privacy and Security:**

  - Support TLS Token Binding for policy-configured sites. TLS Token binding helps prevent token theft attacks to ensure that cookies can't be reused from a device other than the device upon which they were initially set. The use of TLS token binding requires setting the [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy and requires that the sites listed support this feature.

- **Keyboard support for highlighter on PDF files**. Users can use their keyboard keys to highlight any text on a PDF.

- **Printing:**

  - Choose which side to flip on when printing on both sides. Users can choose to flip on the long side or the short side of a sheet when printing on both sides.
  - Choose print rasterization mode for the enterprise. Control how Microsoft Edge prints to a non-PostScript printer on Windows. Sometimes print jobs on non-PostScript printers need to be rasterized to print correctly. The print options are "Full" and "Fast".

### Feature updates

* **Internet Explorer mode:**

   * Let users use the Microsoft Edge User Interface (UI) to test sites in Internet Explorer mode. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86, administrators can enable a UI option for their users to load a tab in Internet Explorer mode for testing purposes or as a stopgap until sites are added to the site list XML.

* **Delete downloads from disk using download manager.** Users are now able to delete their downloaded files from their disk without leaving the browser. The new Delete downloads functionality exists within the context menu of downloads shelf or the downloads page.

* **Roll back to previous Microsoft Edge version.** The rollback feature lets administrators revert to a known good version of Microsoft Edge if there's an issue in the latest version of Microsoft Edge.
[Learn more](edge-learnmore-rollback.md).

* **Enforce enabling Sync by default across the enterprise.**  Administrators can enable synchronization for Microsoft Entra accounts by default with the [ForceSync](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#forcesync) policy.

- **PDF updates:**

  * Table of contents for PDF Documents. Beginning with version 86, Microsoft Edge has added support for table of contents that lets users easily navigate through PDF documents.
  * Access all PDF functionalities on small form factor screens. Access all the capabilities of the Microsoft Edge PDF reader on devices with small screen sizes.
  * Pen support for highlighter on PDF files. With this update, users can use their digital pen to directly highlight text on PDF files, in the same way they would with a physical highlighter and paper.
  * Improved PDF scrolling. You'll now be able to experience stutter free scrolling while navigating through long PDF documents.

* **Automatic profile switching on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.** The automatic profile switching currently available in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 is extended to downlevel Windows (Windows 7, 8, and  8.1). For more information, see the [automatic profile switching](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/04/30/automatic-profile-switching/) blog post.

* **Users will see auto complete suggestions when they start typing a search query on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.** Auto complete will help users quickly complete their search query without having to type the entire string. This is helpful because users won't have to remember correct spellings and they can choose from the available options that are displayed.

* **Remove the HTML5 Application Cache API.**  Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86, the legacy Application Cache API that enables offline use of web pages is being removed from Microsoft Edge. Web Developers should review the [WebDev documentation](https://web.dev/appcache-removal/) for information on replacing  the Application Cache API with Service Workers.  Important: You can request an [AppCache OriginTrial Token](https://developers.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/1776670052997660673) that allows sites to continue to use the deprecated Application Cache API until Microsoft Edge version 90.

* **Security:**

  * Secure DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS) Support.  Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86, settings to control Secure DNS on unmanaged devices is available. These settings aren't accessible to users on managed devices, but IT admins can enable or disable Secure DNS using the [dnsoverhttpsmode](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#dnsoverhttpsmode) group policy.


* **Add a custom image to the New Tab Page (NTP) using a group policy.** Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86 the NTP can replace the default image with a custom user-supplied image. The ability to manage the properties of this image is also supported by the group policy.

* **Match customized keyboard shortcuts to VS Code.** Microsoft Edge DevTools now supports customizing keyboard shortcuts in the DevTools to match with your editor/IDE. (In Microsoft Edge 84, we added the ability to match DevTools keyboard shortcuts to VS Code).

* **Replace [MetricsReportingEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#metricsreportingenabled) and [SendSiteInformationToImproveServices](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#sendsiteinfotoimproveservices) policies for downlevel Windows and macOS.** These policies are deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 86 and will become obsolete in Microsoft Edge version 89.<br>
These policies are replaced by [Allow Telemetry](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization) on Windows 10, and the new [DiagnosticData](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#diagnosticdata) policy for all other platforms. This will let users manage the diagnostic data that gets sent to Microsoft for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and macOS.

* **SameSite=Lax Cookies By Default**. To improve web security and privacy, cookies will now default to [SameSite=Lax](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) handling by default. This means that cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and will be omitted for requests sent to third-parties. This change can cause compatibility impact on websites that require cookies for third-party resources to function correctly. To permit such cookies, web developers can mark cookies which should be set from and sent to third-party contexts by adding explicit `SameSite=none` and `Secure` attributes when the cookie is set. Enterprises that wish to exempt certain sites from this change can do so using the [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabledfordomainlist) policy, or can opt out of the change across all sites using the [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabled) policy.

### Feature updates

- **On-premises synchronization of Favorites and Settings**. Now you can synchronize browser favorites and settings between Active Directory profiles within your own environment without the need for cloud sync.

- **Microsoft Edge group policy support for trusting site + app combos to launch without a confirmation prompt.** Group policy support added that lets administrators add site + app combos that are trusted to launch without the confirmation prompt. This adds the ability for administrators to configure trusted protocol/origin combinations (such as Microsoft 365 apps) for their end-users to suppress the confirmation prompt when navigating to a URL that contains an app protocol.

- **PDF Highlighter tool**. This tool can be added to the toolbar for PDFs to easily highlight important text.

- **The Storage Access API is available**. The Storage Access API allows access to first-party storage in a third-party context when a user has provided a direct intent to allow storage that would otherwise be blocked by the browser's current configuration. For more information, see [Storage Access API](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5612590694662144).

- **Send to OneNote is available for Microsoft Edge Collections**. Everyone's excited to be able to send the information they've gathered in Collections to OneNote, where they can append it to a larger project and collaborate with others! And even more importantly, in Microsoft Edge 85, you'll be able send content to *Office for Mac* products (Word, Excel, and OneNote) for both Microsoft account and Microsoft Entra ID.

- **DevTools updates**. For details about the following updates, see [What's New In DevTools (Microsoft Edge 85)](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2020/06/devtools).

   - Microsoft Edge DevTools supports Surface Duo emulation. The Microsoft Edge DevTools can emulate the Surface Duo so you can test how your web content will look on dual-screen devices. To turn on this experiment in DevTools, enter Device Mode by pressing Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows or Command+Shift+M on macOS, and then select Surface Duo from the device drop-down list.
   - Microsoft Edge DevTools lets you match keyboard shortcuts to VS Code. The Microsoft Edge DevTools supports customizing keyboard shortcuts in the DevTools to match your editor/IDE. In Microsoft Edge 85, we are adding the ability to match DevTools keyboard shortcuts to VS Code. This change will help increase productively across VS Code and DevTools.

### Feature updates

- This version of Microsoft Edge provides improved site list download times for Internet Explorer mode.  We've reduced download delay for the Internet Explorer mode site list to 0 seconds (down from a 60-second wait) in the absence of a cached site list. We've also added group policy support for cases when Internet Explorer mode home page navigations need to be delayed until the site list is downloaded. For more information, see the [DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#delaynavigationsforinitialsitelistdownload) policy.

- Microsoft Edge now allows users to sign-into the browser when it's "run as administrator" on Windows 10. This will help customers running Microsoft Edge on Windows server or in remote-desktop and sandbox scenarios.

- Microsoft Edge now provides full mouse support when in full screen mode. Now you can use your mouse to access tabs, the address bar, and other items without having to exit full screen mode.

- Online purchase improvement. Add custom nicknames to saved debit or credit cards. Now you can distinguish and differentiate your credit cards when making online purchases. Nicknaming your debit or credit cards lets you choose the correct card when using autofill to select a payment method.

- TLS/1.0 and TLS/1.1 are disabled by default. To help discover impacted sites, you can set the *edge://flags/#display-legacy-tls-warnings* flag to cause Microsoft Edge to display a non-blocking "Not Secure" notice when loading pages that require legacy TLS protocols. The [SSLVersionMin](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#sslversionmin) policy permits re-enabling of TLS/1.0 and TLS/1.1. This policy will remain available until at least Microsoft Edge version 88. For more information, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

- Collections improvements:

  - A note capability is added that lets you add a note or comment to an item in a collection. Notes are grouped together and stay attached to an item even if you sort the items in a collection. To try this new feature, right-click on an item and select "Add note".
  - You can change the background color of notes in collections. You can use color coding to help you organize information and increase productivity.
  - There are noticeable performance improvements, which lets you export your collections to  Excel in less time than in previous versions of Microsoft Edge.

- Additional Microsoft Edge API support:

  - The Storage Access API. This API allows access to first-party storage in a third-party context when a user provides a direct intent to allow storage that would otherwise be blocked by the browser's current configuration.

    As privacy is becoming increasingly important to users, requests for stricter browser defaults and user opt-in settings like blocking all third-party storage access are increasingly common. While these settings help improve privacy and block unwanted access by unknown or untrusted parties, they can have unwanted side effects such as blocking access to content the user may want to view (for example, social media and embedded media content.)

  - The Native File System API, which means you can give sites permissions to edit files or folders via the Native File System API.

- PDF improvements:

  - Read Aloud for PDF lets users listen to PDF content while carrying out other tasks that may be important for them. It also helps audio visual learners focus on reading the content, making learning easier.
  - PDF file editing is improved. Now you can save an edit made to a PDF back to the file instead of saving a copy each time you edit the PDF.

- Microsoft Edge now enables Translation in the Immersive Reader. When a user opens the Immersive Reader view, they get the option to translate the page to their desired language.

- DevTools supports customizing keyboard shortcuts to match your editor/IDE, which includes VS Code.

### Policy updates

#### New policies

Five new policies were added. Download the updated Administrative Templates from the [Microsoft Edge Enterprise landing page](https://aka.ms/EdgeEnterprise). The following new policies were added.

- [ApplicationGuardContainerProxy](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#applicationguardcontainerproxy) - Application Guard Container Proxy.
- [DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#delaynavigationsforinitialsitelistdownload) - Require that the Enterprise Mode Site List is available before tab navigation.
- [NativeWindowOcclusionEnabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#nativewindowocclusionenabled) - Enable Hiding of Native Windows.
- [NavigationDelayForInitialSiteListDownloadTimeout](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#navigationdelayforinitialsitelistdownloadtimeout) - Set a timeout for delay of tab navigation for the Enterprise Mode Site List.

#### Deprecated policies

- [BuiltinCertificateVerifierEnabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#builtincertificateverifierenabled) - Determines whether the built-in certificate verifier will be used to verify server certificates.
- [StricterMixedContentTreatmentEnabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#strictermixedcontenttreatmentenabled) - Enable stricter treatment for mixed content.

#### Obsoleted policy

### Feature updates

- Microsoft Defender SmartScreen improvements: Made several improvements to the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen service, such as improved protection from malicious sites that redirect when loading, and top-level frame blocking, which completely replaces malicious sites with the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen safety page. The top-level frame blocking prevents audio and other media from the malicious site from playing which gives an easier and less confusing experience.

- In response to user feedback, users can now exempt certain cookies from automatically clearing when the browser closes. This option is helpful if there's a site that users don't want to be signed out of, but still want to have all the other cookies cleared when the browser closes. To use this feature, go to *edge://settings/clearBrowsingDataOnClose* and enable the "Cookies and other site data" toggle.

- Automatic Profile Switching is now available to help you get to your work content more easily across profiles. If you use multiple profiles at work, you can check it out by navigating to a site requiring authentication from your work or school account while on your personal profile. When we detect a change, you will receive a prompt to switch to your work profile to access that site without having to authenticate to it. When you choose the work profile you want to switch to, the website will open in your work profile. This profile switching capability will help you keep your work and personal data separate and help you get to your work content more effortlessly. If you don't want the feature to prompt you to switch profiles, you can choose the don't ask me again option and it will get out of your way.

- Collections feature improvements:
  - You can use drag and drop to add an item to a collection without opening the collection. During the drag and drop you can also choose a location in the collection list where you want to put the item.
  - You can add multiple items to a collection instead of adding one item at a time. To add multiple items, select the items and then drag them to a collection. Or you can select the items, right-click and then pick the collection where you want the items.

- You can add all the tabs in an Edge window into a new collection without adding them individually. To add all the tabs, right-click on any tab and choose "Add all tabs to a new collection".

- Extension sync is now available. You can now sync your extensions across all your devices! Extensions from both the Microsoft and Chrome Stores will sync with Microsoft Edge. To use this feature: Click the ellipses (**â€¦**) on the menu bar, select **Settings**. Under Your profile, click **Sync** to see the Sync options. Under **Profiles/Sync** use the toggle to enable Extensions. You can use the [SyncTypesListDisabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#synctypeslistdisabled) group policy to disable syncing of extensions.

- Improved the message on the Downloads management page for insecure downloads that have been blocked.

- Immersive Reader improvements:
  - Added support for Adverbs in the Parts of Speech experience we have in Immersive Reader. While reading an article within the Immersive Reader, open the Grammar Tools and switch on Adverbs within Parts of Speech to highlight all the adverbs on the page.
  - Added the ability to select any content on a webpage and open it in Immersive Reader. This ability enables users to use the Immersive Reader and all the Learning Tools, such as Line Focus and Read Aloud, across all websites.

- Link doctor provides host correction and a search query to the users when they mistype a URL. For example: <br>
A user mistypes "powerbi as "powerbbi".com. Link doctor will suggest "powerbi".com as a correction and create a link to search for "powerbbi" in case the user is looking for something different.

- Allow users to save their decision to launch an external protocol for a specific site. Users can configure the [ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#externalprotocoldialogshowalwaysopencheckbox) policy to enable or disable this feature.

- Users can set Microsoft Edge as their default browser directly from Microsoft Edge **Settings**. This capability makes it easier for users to change their default browser, within the context of the browser itself, instead of having to search through the operating system settings. To use this feature, go to *edge://settings/defaultBrowser* and click **Make default**.

- Several DevTools updates, including new remote debugging support, UI improvements, and more. For more information, see [What's New In DevTools (Microsoft Edge 83)](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2020/03/devtools).

### Feature updates

- Collections is now available. You can get started by clicking the Collections icon next to the address bar. This action opens the Collections pane where you can create, edit, and view Collections. We designed Collections based on what you do on the web. If you're a shopper, a traveler, a teacher, or a student, Collections can help. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2019/12/09/improvements-collections-sync-microsoft-edge/#LuDPRDUDCgdgdOVt.97).

- Allow the removal (Hide from toolbar) of the Collections button from the Microsoft Edge toolbar for consistency.

- On-prem Active Directory account auto sign in will only be targeted to organizations that turn it on. If users were already signed in with an on-prem AD account, they will now be able to sign out of it. Now, users will only be automatically signed in with the primary account on their operating system if it is a Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra account. Admins can enable auto sign in with an on-prem AD account using the ConfigureOnPremisesAccountAutoSignIn policy.

- Application Guard. Extensions support now available in the container.

- Added a message to inform users that Internet Explorer isn't installed when they navigate to a page that is configured to open in Internet Explorer mode.

- Updated the 3D View tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools with a new feature to help debug z-index stacking context. 3D View shows a representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) depth using color and stacking, and the z-Index view helps you isolate the different stacking contexts of your page. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/01/23/debug-z-index-3d-view-edge-devtools/).

- Localized the F12 Dev tools in 10 new languages, so they will match the language used in the rest of the browser. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/02/04/localizing-edge-devtools/).

- Added support for Dolby Vision playback. On Dolby Vision-enabled Windows 10 Build 17134 (April 2018 Update), websites can show Dolby vision content. See how to enable Dolby Vision content from [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/42384).

- Microsoft Edge can now identify and remove duplicate favorites and merge folders with the same name. To access the tool, click the star on the browser's toolbar and select "Remove duplicate favorites".  You will be able to confirm changes and any updates to your favorites will be synced across devices.

- We heard from users it can be difficult to distinguish a normal browsing window in dark theme from an InPrivate window since both window frames are dark. The new solid InPrivate blue pill in the top right corner helps reassure users they are browsing InPrivate.

- Open external links in the correct browser profile. Select a default profile for links opened for external apps to open in from *edge://settings/multiProfileSettings*.

- Added a warning to alert users who sign into a browser profile with an account after being previously signed in with another account. This will help prevent unintentional data merging.

- If you have payment cards saved in your Microsoft account, you can use them in Microsoft Edge while filling out payment forms. The cards in your Microsoft account will sync across desktop devices and the full details will be shared with the website after two-factor authentication (CVC code and your Microsoft identity.) For further convenience, you can choose to securely save a copy of the card on the device during authentication.

- Line Focus is designed for users who like to focus on a limited part of the content as they read. It lets users keep the focus on 1, 3 or 5 lines at a time and dims out the rest of the page to let users read without distraction. Users can scroll using touch or arrow keys and the focus shifts accordingly.

- Microsoft Edge is now integrated with Windows Speller on Windows platforms 8.1 and above. This integration provides greater language support, with access to more language dictionaries and the ability to use Windows custom dictionaries. There is no further action needed from the users when a language has been added in the OS language settings and a language spellcheck toggle is enabled in Microsoft Edge settings.

- When PDF documents are opened using Microsoft Edge, users will now be able to create highlights, change color, and delete highlights. This helps in referencing important parts of the document later, and for collaboration.

- When loading long PDF documents that have been optimized for web, the pages being viewed by the user will be loaded faster, parallelly, while the rest of the document is loading.

- Now it's easier to start the Immersive Reader for a website by just pressing the F9 key.

- Now it's easier to start Read Aloud by using a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + U).
