# Copilot in Edge webpage summarization behavior

The following chart explains the current behavior of Copilot in Edge webpage summarization on various document types. This information will be updated when support for summarization increases. This chart covers the behavior in Copilot both when enterprise data protection is applied and when it is not. Support for these document types only applies to Copilot in Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> Contextual grounding in Copilot in Edge: This is the ability to ground a chat conversation in the current webpage context. It applies to prompts such as "Summarize this document" or "What does this page say about…" in reference to the tab currently being viewed by the user in the main Edge window. Contextual grounding only applies to instances of chat when using Copilot in the Edge sidebar, because desktop/full-screen instances do not allow for simultaneous web context.
