# Microsoft Edge hands-on deployment lab

The Microsoft Edge team partnered with the Windows and Office Deployment Lab to create an area for you to test Microsoft Edge in a virtual environment. This lab automates the configuration of a virtual Microsoft 365 desktop/management environment that lets you provision Microsoft Edge in a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager instance.

## About the lab guides

The step-by-step lab guides take you through multiple deployment and management scenarios. These scenarios include the latest versions of [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) and [Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/). You'll see that Microsoft Edge is added to the Device and App Readiness section of the step-by-step labs.

For more information, see the [Windows and Office Deployment Lab Kit](/microsoft-365/enterprise/modern-desktop-deployment-and-management-lab).
