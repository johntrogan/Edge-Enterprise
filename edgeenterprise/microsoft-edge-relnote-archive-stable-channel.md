### Fixes

- **Policy updates to allow wildcards.** The documentation for the following policies were inaccurate and were corrected. These policies support wildcards (*) in URL patterns when being configured: [ImagesAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imagesallowedforurls), [ImagesBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#imagesblockedforurls), [InsecureContentAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentallowedforurls), [InsecureContentBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentblockedforurls), [PopupsAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#popupsallowedforurls), [PopupsBlockedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#popupsblockedforurls).

### Feature updates

- **Update to Microsoft Edge supported operating systems.** The minimum supported macOS version is increased to macOS 11. Users on older versions of macOS will no longer receive Microsoft Edge updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Deprecation of the CryptoWallet feature.** To improve end user experience, the CryptoWallet feature and the [CryptoWalletEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cryptowalletenabled) policy is deprecated. The [CryptoWalletEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cryptowalletenabled) policy will be obsolete in an upcoming release.

### Site compatibility impacting changes

- **Deprecation of non-standard declarative shadow DOM serialization.** The prototype implementation, which shipped in 2020 and then updated in 2023, contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` that could be used to serialize DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype wasn't standardized with the rest of the declarative shadow DOM, and has only recently reached spec consensus (for details, see [GitHub](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/8867). As part of that consensus, the shape of the `getInnerHTML` API changed.

- **Deprecate the includeShadowRoots argument on DOMParser.** The `includeShadowRoots` argument was a never-standardized argument to the `DOMParser.parseFromString()` function, which was there to allow imperative parsing of HTML content that contains declarative shadow DOM. This function was shipped as part of the initial shipment of declarative shadow DOM. Since the standards discussion rematerialized in 2023, the shape of DSD APIs changed, including this feature for imperative parsing.

  Now that a standardized version of this API, in the form of `setHTMLUnsafe()` and `parseHTMLUnsafe()` shipped, the non-standard `includeShadowRoots` argument needs to be deprecated and removed. All usage should shift accordingly:

  Instead of:

  `(new DOMParser()).parseFromString(html,'text/html',{includeShadowRoots: true});`

  This can be used instead:

  `document.parseHTMLUnsafe(html);`

- **Rename inset-area to position-area**. The CSS working group ([CSSWG](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/)) resolved to rename this property from `inset-area` to `position-area`. For more information, see the CSSWG discussion in [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10209#issuecomment-2221005001).

  The old and new property names are supported for a few milestones, to help developers migrate to the new position-area name. We're shipping the new property name, `position-area`, as a synonym for `inset-area`.

  The `inset-area` property is currently planned for removal in Microsoft Edge version 131.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue that caused high CPU usage of renderer processes when running Selenium tests and calling `driver.quit()` to end the testing session.

### Feature updates

- **SSE3 Requirement.**  Microsoft Edge stopped supporting CPUs that lack SSE3. Devices with such CPUs won't receive any more updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Copilot browser Context Policies.** The [DiscoverPageContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#discoverpagecontextenabled) policy is obsoleted in Microsoft Edge version 128 and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 127.

  To summarize and answer questions based on browser context in Microsoft Edge, Copilot needs to be able to access the browser context. We're providing two new policies to offer more flexibility for admins to customize Edge browser context access across Copilot chats in Edge sidebar.

  - [CopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotpagecontext) - Control Copilot access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.
  - [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) - Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.

- **Deprecation of the followable web feature.** To improve end user experience, the followable web feature is deprecated. The [EdgeFollowEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgefollowenabled) policy is also obsolete.

- **EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled policy obsoletion.** The [EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enforcelocalanchorconstraintsenabled) policy was previously deprecated and is now obsolete in Edge version 128. Since Microsoft Edge 112, constraints in certificates loaded from the platform certificate store are enforced. The [EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enforcelocalanchorconstraintsenabled) policy existed as a temporary opt-out in case an enterprise encountered issues with the constraints encoded in their private roots.

- **New Policy for Insecure Downloads over HTTP.** Users that download potentially dangerous content on HTTP sites will receive a UI warning in a future Microsoft Edge version. To prepare for this change, the [ShowDownloadsInsecureWarningsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#showdownloadsinsecurewarningsenabled) policy is now available for admins to enable or disable the warnings related to insecure downloads

- **Edge Bar improvements.** Edge Bar, the detachable version of the Edge sidebar in Windows 10, has a changed entry point from the gear icon at the bottom of the Edge sidebar's fly out menu to the *edge://settings/sidebar* page.  

  For Windows 11 and Windows 10 users, clicking the gear icon will now automatically open the *edge://settings/sidebar* page.

  Also, the ability for Edge Bar to start automatically when starting a Windows 10 device has been enabled again, the Close "X" icon has been moved below the ellipsis menu at the bottom right corner of Edge Bar, and Copilot in Edge will remain within the browser not in Edge Bar. **Note:** These features are a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see these features, check back as we continue our rollout.

  Disabling Edge Bar through the [StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#standalonehubssidebarenabled) policy continues to work, there's a fix to make the UI and briefcase icon appear on the *edge://settings/sidebar* page coming soon.

- **Resolved issue.** Fixed an issue that prevented the Translate icon in the omnibox from being clickable.

### Announcement

- **SSE3 Requirement.** Microsoft Edge will stop supporting CPUs that lack SSE3 in Microsoft Edge 128. Devices with such CPUs won't receive any more updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-supported-operating-systems).

- **Token Binding.** Token Binding uses cryptographic certificates on both ends of the TLS connection in an attempt to close the security gap of bearer tokens, which might be lost or stolen.  We're planning to deprecate Token Binding in Microsoft Edge version 130. The [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy is deprecated and will be obsolete in Microsoft Edge version 130.  

### Feature updates

- **Removal of mutation events.** Support for mutation events was removed. The [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) API can be used instead. Administrators can use the [MutationEventsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#mutationeventsenabled) policy as a temporary workaround. Enterprises should still work to remove their dependencies on these mutation events. For more information, see [Intent to Ship: Deprecate Mutation Events (google.com)](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/jBEISy1p1XU).

- **Gift Card Redemption History in the Hub.** Users with an MSA or Microsoft Entra ID Linked Account can view and utilize information from gift card redemptions through Pay with Rewards or the Rewards Dashboard. Once a user successfully redeems a gift card with Pay with Rewards, information relating to their gift card (date, card number/pin, redemption status) redemption is added to a Redemption History. This information is located in the Wallet hub. Admins can control availability of this feature using the [EdgeWalletCheckoutEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgewalletcheckoutenabled) policy. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Password Monitor policy update.** When the [PasswordMonitorAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordmonitorallowed) policy is enabled as mandatory, users won't see the consent screen to turn on the feature. Also, when set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will be disabled but remain in the 'On' state, and a briefcase icon is made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "This setting is managed by your organization."  For more information, see [Password Monitor auto-enabled for users](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-password-monitor).

### Feature Updates

- **Improved user experience for Purview copy/paste controls in Edge.** Our Purview cut/copy/paste experience is now more user friendly with self-dismissing dialogs on successful paste. The existing "Paste to supported browsers" setting allows organizations to classify and protect the content that end users can paste – both to specific websites and through supported browsers. You can follow the instructions in [Use Endpoint data loss prevention (DLP)](/purview/endpoint-dlp-using?tabs=purview#create-your-dlp-policy) to create the DLP policy.

- **New Workspaces color display: browser window outline.** Workspaces each have a dedicated color, and that color is now displayed as an outline on the browser window. The previous experience applied the color across the entire tab strip in horizontal tab orientation, and across the title bar in vertical tab orientation. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Full Favorites Bar available in Workspaces.** Workspaces now display a user's full set of favorites in the Favorites Bar, with a dedicated workspace folder accessible from the bar. The previous experience replaced the Favorites Bar with the workspace favorites folder. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#april-26-2024).

**Announcement: Insecure downloads over HTTP**

Users that download potentially dangerous content on HTTP sites will receive a UI warning, (for example, "sample.exe can't be downloaded securely"). The user can still choose to proceed by selecting "Keep" on the downloaded item's "..." menu. Admins can also use the [InsecureContentAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecurecontentallowedforurls) policy to specify HTTP sites where the warning will be suppressed. The warning's enablement in Edge 124 was accidental. We have reverted the warning in this Stable Release. Admins can use the `InsecureDownloadWarnings` feature flag to test the impact of this upcoming feature. **Note:** The warning is planned to be turned on in a future Microsoft Edge version. (***Announcement updated May 9, 2024***)

### Fixes

- Removes "Microsoft chat provider for Copilot in Windows" from Windows Server devices. The component was incorrectly installed on some devices in a previous Microsoft Edge update.

### Feature updates

- **Email notifications for extension requests in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service now provides admins with the ability to receive email notifications for extensions that their users have requested. Once enabled, this will help inform them promptly of any new pending requests that they may have.

The following Dev channel updates preceded this Stable channel release. The following Dev notes provide detailed information about the changes in each release.

- [Dev Channel update to 124.0.2438.2 is live. - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/dev-channel-update-to-124-0-2438-2-is-live/m-p/4079136)

### Feature updates

- **Email notifications for extension requests in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service provides admins with the ability to receive email notifications for extensions that their users requested. This notification helps inform them promptly of any new feedback. **Note:** This experience is in public preview and can be accessed by opting in to targeted release in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Enterprise secure AI controls in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service now provides a new dedicated space for admins to manage all AI-related policies in the Edge browser. This helps enhance security and productivity for managed users and devices.

- **Customize organization branding using the Microsoft Edge management service.** Admins can customize their organization's branding assets onto Edge for Business through the Microsoft Edge management service. This branding can help users signed in with a Microsoft Entra ID more easily differentiate between multiple profiles and browser windows through visual cues on the profile pill, profile flyout, and Edge for Business taskbar icon.

  This Microsoft Edge management service feature gives admins an enhanced experience to configure, preview, and customize how Edge for Business shows the following organization brand assets:

  - Organization name
  - Accent color
  - Organization logo
  - Edge for Business taskbar icon overlay

  **Note:** This experience is in public preview and can be accessed by opting in to targeted release in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge for Business](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business) and [Organization branding](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-organization-branding).

- **Automatic profile switching controls for Microsoft Edge for Business in the Microsoft Edge management service.** The Microsoft Edge management service provides admins with the ability to configure settings for automatic profile switching in the Microsoft Edge browser. This can help enforce context separation between their end users' work and personal browsing.

- **Updated Edge Profile account re-authentication popup when Browser to Web Single-Sign-On (SSO) fails.** Edge provides a browser to Web single sign-on (SSO) capability that lets a user sign in to their Edge Profile with a web account first and then automatically sign them into Microsoft first party websites.

  This is done by saving cached credentials. This approach works until there's an authentication challenge to the cached credentials. A typical scenario is when a user changes their password on a different device. The cached credentials on the current device become outdated and SSO fails. Edge detects this failure and shows a re-authentication popup that prompts the user to update their cached credentials on the current device.

- **Removal of Web SQL -  Web SQL support is completely removed.** In prior releases, Web SQL support was disabled by default but could be re-enabled via the [WebSQLAccess](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies?branch=pr-en-us-4103#websqlaccess) policy. After this change, there is no longer any mechanism to enable Web SQL support. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, see [Intent to Deprecate and Remove Web SQL](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/fWYb6evVA-w/m/pziWcvboAgAJ).

- **Cross-device Search Query History suggestions.**  The existing Search Query suggestions have been enhanced with cross-device query history in both Recent Searches and browser searches for enterprise users who have enabled Edge Sync across devices/browsers. From now on Edge will provide you with the relevant query history suggestions that you have previously searched before no matter where you did it. You can always trust Edge to help you quickly re-find the information that you accessed before.

- **Extending support for viewing MIP Protected PDF Files to different sovereignties (including GCCH).** Sovereign cloud customers (including GCCH) will be able to open MIP protected PDF content in Microsoft Edge. This change will be available in the Microsoft Edge built-in PDF reader powered by Adobe Acrobat and the legacy Microsoft Edge PDF engine. **Note:** This feature is an experiment.  Admins can use the feature flag "**msMIPSovereigntyPdfViewSupport**" to test this feature.  

- **Copilot browser Context Policies.**
 To summarize and answer questions based on browser context in Microsoft Edge, Copilot needs to be able to access the browser context. We're providing two new policies to offer more flexibility for admins to customize Edge browser context access across Copilot chats in Edge sidebar.

   - [CopilotPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotpagecontext) - Control Copilot access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.
   - [CopilotCDPPageContext](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#copilotcdppagecontext) - Control Copilot with Commercial Data Protection access to browser context for Microsoft Entra ID profiles.
   - The [DiscoverPageContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#discoverpagecontextenabled) policy is deprecated in Edge version 124 and will be obsoleted in Edge version 127.

- **Inline Compose.** This feature allows users to rewrite text using Copilot. Users can highlight text they'd like to improve when writing in Edge and use the Rewrite tool to iterate with different lengths, formats, and tones. Administrators can control availability using the [ComposeInlineEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#composeinlineenabled) policy.

- **Updated profile management and customization controls.**
Enhancing the profile management and customization experience through surfaced profile controls and an expanded range of default avatars. With these updates, users can effortlessly tailor their profiles to their preferences and select from a broader collection of profile avatars.

- **Microsoft Edge migrates the updates experience into Browser Essentials.** Notifications on available Edge Updates will come from Browser Essentials instead of the Settings page for better visibility and experience.

- **Desktop Shortcut for New Enterprise Devices.** New Microsoft Enterprise devices, including Windows Enterprise SKUs, Windows Server SKUs and any domain-joined or AAD-joined devices, running through Windows Out of Box Experience (OOBE) for the first time will see a Microsoft Edge desktop shortcut automatically created. This desktop shortcut provides users with an alternative way to access their Microsoft Edge browser without needing to manually pin and configure their set-up.

- **Updated profile options in new profile experience.** Many users unintentionally create empty profiles, cluttering their workspace and impeding their browsing experience. To reduce clutter and the likelihood of profile churn, updated First Run Experience (FRE) string options encourage users to sign-in and meaningfully create profiles for an improved browsing experience, or easily cancel unintentional creation.

- **Updated default profile pill for EDU users in Edge for Business.** To improve the applicability of the current Edge for Business default visuals, users signed in with an EDU account will see the default profile pill label updated to "School".

- **Updated UX for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint blocks.** Microsoft Edge now provides a different blocking experience for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint based blocks (Web Content Filtering and Custom Indicators). For more information, see [Web protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/web-protection-overview?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Feature updates

- **Enable organization branding in Edge for Business.**   Enable your organization's branding assets from Entra onto profile-related UI for profiles signed in with a Microsft Entra ID account. You can add your organization's details such as name to the profile pill, name and brand color to the profile flyout, and logo to overlay the Edge for Business taskbar icon. This branding can help users more easily differentiate between multiple profiles and browser windows.

  Default organization branding can be enabled by admins through the following policies:

  - [OrganizationalBrandingOnWorkProfileUIEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#organizationalbrandingonworkprofileuienabled
)
  - [OrganizationLogoOverlayOnAppIconEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#organizationlogooverlayonappiconenabled)

  Admins need to have "company branding" assets configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center for branding assets to be applied to this feature.

  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge for Business](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-for-business) and [Add company branding to your organization's sign-in page](/entra/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding).

- **Microsoft Edge migrates the updates experience into Browser Essentials.** Getting alerts on available Edge Updates will come from Browser Essentials instead of the Settings page for better visibility and experience. **Note:** This feature is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Added support for AVIF and AV1 file formats.** Microsoft Edge now supports the AVIF and AV1 file formats, which offer better compression and higher quality images and videos.  Users can enjoy faster loading times and better quality media on websites.  

- **E-tree in Wallet.** Users signed into Microsoft Edge with a personal Microsoft Account (MSA) can grow a virtual seed into a tree with Wallet. Once it's grown, a real tree is planted.  Administrators can control the availability using the [EdgeWalletEtreeEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgewalletetreeenabled) policy.

- **New Website Typo Protection policies.** The built-in Website Typo Protection warns users if it appears there's a mistyped popular domain name that could land users on a malicious webpage.  Administrators can control the availability and configure Website Typo Protection by using the [PreventTyposquattingPromptOverride](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#preventtyposquattingpromptoverride) and [TyposquattingAllowListDomains](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#typosquattingallowlistdomains) policies.

### Policy updates

### Feature updates

- **RendererAppContainer.** For extra security benefits, the Windows native app container is enabled by default. Note: If Enterprise organizations identify a compatibility issue due to code injection from security software, they should follow up with the software publisher directly. Alternatively, they can use the [RendererAppContainerEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#rendererappcontainerenabled) policy to trade off the security benefits in Microsoft Edge with their other software.

- **Updated SmartActionsBlockList policy.** The [SmartActionsBlockList](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#smartactionsblocklist) policy is updated with new policy option mappings.

### Announcement: Icon change in Edge sidebar

In an upcoming update to Microsoft Edge, the Bing icon entry point in the Microsoft Edge sidebar changes to the new Copilot icon. No other changes in the experience are expected.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge for Business Banner.**  Microsoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser across managed and unmanaged devices. The in-product Microsoft Edge for Business banner is being deprecated and will no longer be visible.

- **Find on page.** Searching for a word or phrase on a webpage is easier with the new smart find update to Find on page. For more information, see
[Find on page](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/find-on-page?form=MT00D8). Now when you search with Find on page, we suggest related matches and synonyms making it effortless to find what you're looking for, even if you misspell a word in your search query. When you search, select the suggested word to quickly locate the desired word or phrase on the page. Data is sent to Microsoft for processing.  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge's Privacy Whitepaper](/microsoft-edge/privacy-whitepaper/). Administrators can control the availability using the [RelatedMatchesCloudServiceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#relatedmatchescloudserviceenabled) policy.

- **New SmartScreen policy.**  The [ExemptSmartScreenDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptsmartscreendownloadwarnings) policy lets administrators create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that are exempted from SmartScreen AppRep warnings.  Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy are still subject to file type extension-based security warnings and mixed-content download warnings.

- **New Microsoft Edge Update policies.** The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** and **MeteredUpdates** policies allows administrators to control the "Download Updates over metered connections" setting (`edge://settings/help`). The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** applies to all apps and **MeteredUpdates** applies to targeted apps. When a policy is configured to Allow, updates occur on a metered connection, such as cellular connections or others where data usage is controlled.

- **Support for WindowsTabManager API.** Microsoft Edge version 118 uses the new public Windows WindowTabManager API for more information, see [WindowTabManager Class (Windows.UI.Shell) - Windows UWP applications](/uwp/api/windows.ui.shell.windowtabmanager) to support features such as showing browser tabs in Alt+Tab, tab tearout, and taskbar pin glomming.

### Announcement: Microsoft Edge for Business is available for unmanaged Windows devices

Microsoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser. This dedicated work experience is now available for unmanaged Windows devices using Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management (MAM). This release includes the supporting changes for Microsoft Edge. When the required Intune update is released, more information is available on how to test and deploy this feature with your users.

**Note:**

- Support is available for Windows 11, build 10.0.22621 (22H2) or later.

- Requires Microsoft Intune 2309 or higher

- App Protection Conditional Access is in Public Preview.

- If you have a Conditional Access (CA) policy on your tenant that targets "All cloud apps" that covers "Mobile apps and desktop clients" and requires a compliant device, app protection policies or has a "Block" grant control, your end users won't be able to MAM enroll. A change to support this is targeted for Microsoft Edge v118.

- If you want to continue testing/evaluating APP CA, you can choose to exclude the "Edge Auth" application from your cloud app targeting. Some Microsoft Edge features might not function properly until CA is satisfied, but MAM enrollment will be able to complete.

### Announcement: Deprecating the unload event

The Google Chrome team plans to deprecate the unload event starting in Chrome version 118. The deprecation occurs by gradually changing the default so unload handlers stop firing on pages unless a page explicitly opts in to re-enable them. For more information, see [Deprecating the unload event - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deprecating-unload/), and [Google Groups - Conversations](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/dvusqw9-IhI/m/SBkm_u1RAQAJ).

While we haven't yet finalized the deprecation schedule, we anticipate that Microsoft Edge will follow Chrome's schedule with a possible delay of a release or two. If you're interested in testing with Microsoft Edge starting in version 118, the **ForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled** policy is available or you can use the instructions documented at [Disable unload handlers by default and add Permissions-Policy to opt-in to enabling them](https://github.com/fergald/docs/blob/master/explainers/permissions-policy-deprecate-unload.md#disable-unload-handlers-by-default-and-add-permissions-policy-to-opt-in-to-enabling-them).

WebView2 supports both the permissions policy and the enterprise policy but won't be impacted by the gradual rollout in Microsoft Edge. We expect WebView2 will switch defaults when the rollout reaches 100% of page loads.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge for Business Banner.**  Administrators can control the availability of the in-product Microsoft Edge for Business banner using the [PromotionalTabsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#promotionaltabsenabled) policy.

- **Microsoft Edge Sync Favorites Recovery.** The Microsoft Edge Sync Favorites Recovery feature lets sync users restore any favorites that they lost or deleted within the last 14 days. Users can access this feature from either the Microsoft Edge favorites hub or the `edge://favorites` page. For more information, see [Recover lost or deleted favorites in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/recover-lost-or-deleted-favorites-in-microsoft-edge-ac06270e-ba57-4266-8389-8bfd1df1aa5e)

- **Autofill Autocomplete.** This feature helps you fill form fields faster on the web. When you start typing in a form field, Microsoft Edge suggests possible in-line completions when there's an exact match with your saved data in the browser. For example, if you type the first few characters of your address, autocomplete suggests the rest of address - you can choose the autocomplete suggestion or continue typing as usual. Autofill options can be found in Settings (`edge://settings/personalinfo`).

- **Deprecation of Web Select.** To improve end user experience, this feature is being deprecated and will no longer be an option under Web Capture or via keyboard shortcut.

- **Deprecation of features.** To improve end user experience and simplify the **More tools** menu, the following features are being deprecated: Math Solver, Picture Dictionary, Citations, Grammar Tools, and Kids Mode.

As an opt-in experience in Windows 10, users can attach the sidebar to their Windows desktop by clicking a "popout" icon near the base of the sidebar in the browser. This enables a side-by-side experience that works with any Windows app—including Microsoft Edge itself. Users enjoy streamlined access to the same set of powerful AI tools and web-based services, including Bing Chat, without launching a browser window, enhancing productivity regardless of where they are in Windows. More features and options are planned in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

For more information, see [Browse more safely with Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-browse-safer).

- **Switch from Microsoft Autoupdate to EdgeUpdater for macOS**. Microsoft Edge for macOS will start using a new updater named EdgeUpdater. This change only affects Microsoft Edge on macOS. If you use update preferences for Microsoft Autoupdate to prevent browser updates, you'll need to transition to the new EdgeUpdater UpdateDefault policy before Microsoft Edge 113 to prevent future automatic updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge for macOS switches from Microsoft AutoUpdate to EdgeUpdater](/deployedge/edge-learnmore-edgeupdater-for-macos).

- **New policy for PDF View Settings.** The [RestorePdfView](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#restorepdfview) policy lets Admins control PDF View Recovery in Microsoft Edge.  When enabled or if the policy isn't configured, Microsoft Edge recovers the last state of PDF view and land users on the section where they ended reading in the last session.

For more information, see [Browse more safely with Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-browse-safer).

- **Added features for web app policy.** The [WebAppInstallForceList](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#webappinstallforcelist) policy lets administrators configure a list of web apps that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off. This policy now supports custom_name, which permanently overrides the app name of installed apps and custom_icon, which permanently overrides the app icon of installed apps.

- **In-browser JSON viewer.**  Improvements to how JSON files are displayed in the browser, which includes a color-coded tree view with line numbers and the ability to collapse and expand the data.  This functionality triggers automatically when the browser navigates to a JSON file on the web or the user opens a local one.  More features and enhancements roll out as available.  For more information, see [View formatted JSON - Microsoft Edge Development](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/json-viewer/json-viewer).  Note: This is a controlled feature rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout or you can navigate to `edge://flags` and search for JSON Viewer to manually enable.  

- **Updated new tab page policy.** The [NewTabPageHideDefaultTopSites](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#newtabpagehidedefaulttopsites) policy hides the default top sites from the new tab page in Microsoft Edge. Starting on March 20, when the policy is enabled it will also remove sponsored quick links from the new tab page.

- **Edit and save web images in Microsoft Edge.** You can right click on the desired web image and without leaving your browser window, crop, adjust lighting and color, and add filters. From there, you can save the edited image for later use. You can also start editing simply by hovering over an image and selecting edit image from the menu.

### Policy updates

### Feature update

- **New Microsoft Edge PDF experience policy.**  As part of the Adobe and Microsoft collaboration to re-envision the future workplace and your digital experiences, we're natively embedding the Adobe Acrobat PDF engine into the Microsoft Edge built-in PDF reader, with a release scheduled in March 2023. Administrators can start testing the new Microsoft Edge PDF reader that is powered by the Adobe Acrobat PDF engine by enabling the [NewPDFReaderEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#newpdfreaderenabled) policy.  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge and Adobe partner to improve the PDF experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-edge-insider/microsoft-edge-and-adobe-partner-to-improve-the-pdf-experience/ba-p/3733481).  

- **Microsoft Edge Sidebar Improvements.** The Microsoft Edge sidebar lets users access productivity tools side-by-side with their browsing window. In this release, the sidebar is enhanced to increase productivity and improve user experience. As communicated in our last release ([Microsoft Edge release notes for Stable Channel](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnote-stable-channel#version-1110166141-march-13-2023)), the sidebar now includes a toolbar button by default to access the experience. If admins enable the Discover app, hovering and clicking the toolbar button will invoke both the sidebar tower, and the new discover experience.

   With this release, admins now have the ability to disable the Discover app and still keep the Sidebar. In this situation, the Sidebar tower will always be shown. If an Admin chooses to enable the Sidebar but disable the Discover experience, the Sidebar can only be always shown or hidden. This default visibility can be changed in the Sidebar settings (*edge://settings/sidebar*).
 
   When an admin enables the Sidebar and the Discover experience, enterprise users can choose to 'always show', or 'auto hide'. More customization options for the sidebar toolbar button are planned in future versions of Microsoft Edge.  For more information, see [Manage the sidebar in Microsoft Edge](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-sidebar).

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#march-13-2023).

### Feature update

- **A New Microsoft Edge Sidebar.** In this release, the Sidebar introduces several new features and improvements aimed at enhancing productivity, convenience, and the user experience. Here are some of the highlights:<br><br>

  - **The New Discover:** Edge Copilot is a powerful tool that helps users boost their productivity and efficiency. It provides intelligent suggestions and insights based on the context of the web page and the user's goals. As the new Bing icon in the Toolbar, Edge Copilot helps users compose better emails, search the web faster, learn new skills, all done more conveniently.  
  - **Enhanced Sidebar Visibility:** With the new Auto-Hide functionality, a user can maximize the productivity and convenience of the sidebar without sacrificing valuable screen space. The Edge Sidebar can be hidden when a user isn't using it and it only reappears when a user needs it.  
  - **Evolved Sidebar Interaction:** The new Hover functionality lets users open the Sidebar by hovering on the Bing icon in the Toolbar. This enhances user productivity and convenience by providing a seamless and intuitive way to access their most used tools.  

  Admins retain the ability to control and customize the Sidebar and its experiences, as needed by using the following settings:<br><br>

  - If admins enable the Sidebar, users have access to the Sidebar and Edge Copilot experience. The Sidebar always shows in the browser frame. Clicking on the Bing icon in the Toolbar invokes the new Discover experience.
  - If admins choose the 'not configured' setting, users have access to the Sidebar and Edge Copilot experience. Unlike when the Sidebar is 'enabled', their users have the ability to always-show or autohide the Sidebar.
  - If admins disable the Sidebar, Discover and the Sidebar will be inaccessible for their users. **Note:** In this release, Admins don't have the ability to disable Discover and keep the Sidebar.

  More customization options for the sidebar toolbar button are planned in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

  For more information, see [Manage the sidebar in Microsoft Edge](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-sidebar) and [Microsoft Privacy Statement (Search, Microsoft Edge, and artificial intelligence)](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).

- **Microsoft Feed on Microsoft 365 Edge New Tab Page.** We're rolling out a new experience to the Microsoft 365 tab of the Edge Enterprise New Tab Page. This experience features a new layout that centers on a larger version of the Microsoft Feed, featuring more productivity content, and moves the productivity cards including Important Emails, Recent SharePoint sites, Upcoming events, and To Do to the right-hand side of the Microsoft 365 tab.

- **Enhanced security mode improvements.** Enhanced security mode now supports WebAssembly for macOS x64 and Linux x64. More cross-platform (ARM64) support is expected in the future. For more information, see [Browse more safely with Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-browse-safer).

- **New policy to clear IE mode data on browser exit.** The [InternetExplorerModeClearDataOnExitEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorermodecleardataonexitenabled) policy controls whether browsing history is deleted from Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer mode every time Microsoft Edge is closed. Users can also configure this setting in the 'Clear browsing data for Internet Explorer' option in the Privacy, search, and services menu of Settings (*edge://settings/privacy*).

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#february-9-2023).

### Feature updates

- **New Immersive Reader policies.** Immersive Reader in Microsoft Edge simplifies web page layouts, removes clutter, and helps you customize your reading experience. Admins using these new policies ([ImmersiveReaderGrammarToolsEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#immersivereadergrammartoolsenabled) and [ImmersiveReaderPictureDictionaryEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#immersivereaderpicturedictionaryenabled)), can control the availability of Grammar Tools and Picture Dictionary features within Immersive Reader.

- **Enabling sync for Microsoft Entra ID signed in customers.** Microsoft Edge sync roams data across all signed in instances of Microsoft Edge. This data includes favorites, passwords, browsing history, open tabs, settings, apps, collections, and extensions.  For Microsoft Entra users who have sync turned off, after the browser is launched they see a notification prompt and have sync turned on for all signed in instances of Microsoft Edge. This sync enablement includes other devices where they're signed in. Additionally, if a user's other devices don't have history and open tabs sync on, those two toggles are turned on. Organizations using the [SyncDisabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#syncdisabled) policy aren't affected by this change.

- **Drop.** Microsoft Edge now offers a simple way to send files and notes across all your signed in mobile and desktop devices. Using the desktop version of Microsoft Edge, Drop can be managed through the sidebar (*edge://settings/sidebar*).  Administrators can control the availability of Drop using the [EdgeEDropEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#edgeedropenabled) policy.

### Feature updates

- **Account Linking between a personal Microsoft account (MSA) and Microsoft Entra account.** Microsoft is enabling users to link a personal Microsoft account (MSA) and Microsoft Entra account through work or school.  Once linked, users can earn Microsoft Rewards points for Microsoft Bing searches done in their browser or Windows search box while signed in with their work or school account. For more information, see the [Account Linking FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/account-linking-faq-c66effb9-02e6-49c0-89e1-ae4d8644e6f7) and the [Account Linking IT Admins FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/account-linking-it-admins-faq-72f0dc4e-b632-439e-b90c-347043a7b75a). Tenant admins can also control this feature in the Message Center section of the Microsoft 365 Admin Center or by using the [LinkedAccountEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#linkedaccountenabled) policy.

- **TLS server certificate verification changes.** In Microsoft Edge version 111, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be decoupled from the host operating system's root store.  Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be provided by and shipped with the browser.  The [MicrosoftRootStoreEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#microsoftrootstoreenabled) policy is now available for testing to control when the built-in root store and certificate verifier are used.  Support for the policy is planned to be removed in Microsoft Edge version 113.  For more information, see [Changes to Microsoft Edge browser TLS server certificate verification | Microsoft Learn](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification).  **Note:** This is a controlled feature rollout in Microsoft Edge version 109.  If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

-  **Text prediction.** To help you write faster and with fewer mistakes, Microsoft Edge provides word and sentence predictions for long-form editable text fields on web pages. For more information, see [Text Prediction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/text-prediction?msockid=2bf3e0ce845a692534f7f4ed857768e4&form=MA13FJ). When you type on editable text fields on Edge, data is sent to Microsoft for processing. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Privacy Whitepaper - Microsoft Edge Development](/microsoft-edge/privacy-whitepaper/). Administrators can control the availability of text predictions using the [TextPredictionEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#textpredictionenabled) policy. Text prediction is currently only available in English within the US, India, and Australia. We'll continue to add new languages and regions in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

### Feature updates

- **Three-digit version number in the User-agent string.** Microsoft Edge will now send a three-digit version number, such as Edg/100 in the User-Agent header. This may confuse scripts or server-side analytics that use a buggy parser to determine the User-Agent string version number. You can use the [ForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgent](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#forcemajorversiontominorpositioninuseragent) policy to control whether the User-Agent string major version should be frozen at 99. Also, the **#force-major-version-to-minor** flag is available in *edge://flags* to freeze the major version in the User-Agent string to 99.

- **Streamlining Microsoft 365 Application Protocol Activations.** Microsoft 365 Application Protocol Activations on trusted Microsoft cloud storage services will now launch certain Microsoft 365 applications directly, including SharePoint subdomains and Microsoft OneDrive URLs. You can use the policies [AutoLaunchProtocolsComponentEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autolaunchprotocolscomponentenabled) and [AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autolaunchprotocolsfromorigins) to enable the application protocol activation prompts if desired, and to define other applications and services where warnings are enabled or disabled.

- **Hardware-enforced Stack Protection.** Microsoft Edge continues supporting more fine-grained protection by combating memory corruption vulnerabilities and by protecting indirect calls. Hardware-enforced stack protection is only supported by Windows 8 and later. For more information, see [Hardware-enforced Stack Protection](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals-blog/developer-guidance-for-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/2163340). This feature behavior can be controlled using the [ShadowStackCrashRollbackBehavior](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#shadowstackcrashrollbackbehavior) policy.

- **Preview PDF files in Microsoft Outlook and File Explorer.** Users can view a PDF file in a lightweight and rich read-only preview. This feature is available for Outlook Desktop PDF attachments or for local PDF files using File Explorer.

- **Open Digitally Signed PDF files.** Digital signatures are used extensively to validate the authenticity of a document and changes made in a document. You can use the [PDFSecureMode](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#pdfsecuremode) policy to enable digital signature validation for PDF files, directly from the browser, without the need for any add-ins.

### Policy updates

### Feature updates

- **Upcoming three-digit version number in user agent string.** Starting with version 100, Microsoft Edge sends a three-digit version number in the User-Agent header, for example "Edg/100". Starting with Microsoft Edge 97, site owners can test this upcoming agent string by enabling the **#force-major-version-to-100** experiment flag in *edge://flags* to ensure their User-Agent parsing logic is robust and works as expected.

- **Personalize multi-profile experiences with profile preferences for sites.** Users can personalize their multi-profile experience with the ability to create a customized list of sites for automatic profile switching in Microsoft Edge.

- **Navigate PDF documents using page thumbnails.** You'll now be able to navigate through your PDF document using thumbnails that represent the pages. These thumbnails appear in the pane on the left side of the PDF reader.

- **Configure the list of domains for which the password manager User Interface (UI) for Save and Fill will be disabled.** Use the [PasswordManagerBlocklist](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#passwordmanagerblocklist) policy to configure the list of domains (HTTP/HTTPS schemas and hostnames only) where Microsoft Edge should disable the password manager. This means that Save and Fill workflows will be disabled, which ensures that passwords for those websites can't be saved or auto filled into web forms.

- **Custom primary password.** The browser already has the capability where users can add an authentication step before saved passwords are auto filled in web forms. This adds another layer of privacy and helps prevent unauthorized users from using saved passwords to sign in to websites. Custom primary password is an evolution of that same feature, where users will now be able to use a custom string of their choice as their primary password. After it's enabled, users will enter this password to authenticate themselves and have their saved passwords auto filled into web forms.

### Feature updates

- **Enhance your security on the web.** This is a browsing mode in Microsoft Edge where browser security takes priority, giving users an extra layer of protection when browsing the web. Administrators can apply group policies to end-user desktops (Windows, macOS, and Linux) to help protect against in-the-wild exploits (also referred to 0-days). The following group policies support this browsing mode:

  - [EnhanceSecurityMode](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymode)
  - [EnhanceSecurityModeBypassListDomains](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymodebypasslistdomains)
  - [EnhanceSecurityModeEnforceListDomains](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#enhancesecuritymodeenforcelistdomains)

- **Upcoming three-digit version number in user agent string.** Starting with version 100, Microsoft Edge sends a three-digit version number in the User-Agent header, for example "Edg/**100**". Starting with Microsoft Edge 97, site owners can test this upcoming user agent string by enabling the **#force-major-version-to-100** experiment flag in *edge://flags* to ensure their User-Agent parsing logic is robust and works as expected.

- **Deprecate WebRTC's Plan B SDP semantics.** This change deprecates a legacy Session Description Protocol (SDP) dialect called Plan B. This SDP format is being replaced by the Unified Plan, which is a spec-compliant and cross-browser compatible SDP format. For more information, see the Chrome Platform Status entry [PSA: Plan B should throw in M96 Beta and Stable](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5823036655665152), and [PSA: Plan B throwing in Stable and Extended Deprecation Trial End Date](https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/gEHrZyYKsfU). Requesting a [Trial for RTCPeerConnection Plan B SDP Semantics](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/3892235977954951169) allows sites to continue to use the deprecated API until version 101.

- **Overlay scrollbars added to Microsoft Edge.** We've updated our scrollbars with an overlay-based design. Users can turn on this feature in *edge://flags*.

## Version 97.0.1072.76: January 27

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

### Feature updates

- **Upcoming three-digit version number in user agent string.** Starting with version 100, Microsoft Edge sends a three-digit version number in the User-Agent header, for example "Edg/**100**". Starting with Microsoft Edge 97, site owners can test this upcoming user agent string by enabling the **#force-major-version-to-100** experiment flag in *edge://flags* to ensure their User-Agent parsing logic is robust and works as expected.

## Version 96.0.1054.75: January 21

Fixed various bugs and performance issues for Extended Stable release.

## Version 97.0.1072.69: January 20

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#january-20-2022).

## Version 97.0.1072.55: January 6

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#january-6-2022).

### Feature updates

- **Use the current profile to sign into websites when multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device.** When multiple work or school accounts are signed in on a device, users are asked to choose an account from the account picker to continue their visits to websites. In this release, users are prompted to let Microsoft Edge sign in to the websites automatically with the work or school account that's signed into the current profile. Users can turn this feature on and off in **Settings** > **Profile preferences**.

- **Add support for Microsoft Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) on macOS.** Microsoft Endpoint DLP policy enforcement is available natively on macOS.

- **Automatic HTTPS.** Users can upgrade navigation from HTTP to HTTPS on domains likely to support this more secure protocol. This support can also be configured to attempt delivery over HTTPS for all domains. Note: This feature is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back as we continue our rollout.

- **Block WebSQL in 3rd-party contexts.** Use of the legacy WebSQL feature will be blocked from 3rd-party frames. The [WebSQLInThirdPartyContextEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#websqlinthirdpartycontextenabled) policy is available as an opt-out option until Microsoft Edge version 101. This change is happening in the Chromium project that Microsoft Edge is based on. For more information, see this [Chrome Platform Status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5684870116278272) entry.

- **Citations in Microsoft Edge.** Citing sources for research is a common requirement for students. They have to manage many research references and sources, which aren't easy tasks. They also have to translate these citations to proper citation formats like APA, MLA, and Chicago. This new "Citations" feature, now in Preview in Microsoft Edge, gives students a better way to manage and generate citations as they research online. With Citations turned on in Collections or from **Settings and more (Alt-F)**, Microsoft Edge automatically generates citations that students can use later so they can stay focused on their research. When they're done, they can easily compile these citations into a final deliverable. For more information, see [Previewing Citations in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/11/04/preview-citations-feature-edge/).

- **Control Flow Guard (CFG).** Microsoft Edge starts supporting more fine-grained protection by combating memory corruption vulnerabilities and by protecting indirect calls. CFG is only supported with Windows 8 and later. For more information, see [Control Flow Guard](/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard).

### Feature updates

- **Cloud Site List Management for IE mode in Public Preview.** Cloud Site List Management lets you manage your site lists for IE mode in the cloud without needing an on-premises infrastructure to host your organization's site list. You can access the Cloud Site List Management feature using the Microsoft Edge Site Lists experience in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. To learn more, see the [Cloud Site List Management for IE mode (Public Preview)](./edge-ie-mode-cloud-site-list-mgmt.md) article.
  
- **Improved handoff between IE mode and the modern browser.** Starting with this version of Microsoft Edge, navigation between Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer mode includes form data and extra HTTP headers. Referrer headers, post data, forms data, and request methods are forwarded correctly across the two experiences. You can specify which data types should be included using the InternetExplorerIntegrationComplexNavDataTypes policy. For more information, see this FAQ: [My application requires transferring POST data between IE mode and Microsoft Edge. Is this supported?](./edge-ie-mode-faq.md#my-application-requires-transferring-post-data-between-ie-mode-and-microsoft-edge-is-this-supported)

- **Update Microsoft Edge WebView2 using WSUS.** IT Admins using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to update Microsoft Edge will also be able to update Microsoft Edge WebView2 using WSUS. This capability gives admins an easier servicing process for offline devices.

- **WSUS updates for Server.** WSUS and Catalog updates for Microsoft Edge channels (Stable, Beta, and Dev) will now apply to Windows Server SKUs that have Microsoft Edge installed, including Windows Server 2022. For more information on how to configure WSUS updates for Microsoft Edge, see [Update Microsoft Edge](/mem/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/deploy-edge).

- **Microsoft Edge AutoLaunch Protocols Component.** Microsoft Edge 96 introduces the AutoLaunch Protocols [Component](https://textslashplain.com/2019/07/16/updating-browsers-quickly-flags-respins-and-components/) that contains lists of scheme-origin dictionaries to automatically allow or block. This protects customers from dangerous schemes (for example, a protocol handler with a 0-day) while eliminating prompts from known-safe pairings (for example, the Teams website can open the Teams client app). If for some reason, you don't want Microsoft Edge to block vulnerable protocol handlers and allow known-safe pairings, use the toggle in *edge://settings/content/applicationLinks*, or set the [AutoLaunchProtocolsComponentEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autolaunchprotocolscomponentenabled) policy to False.

- **Launch Progressive Web App (PWA) directly via protocol links.** Let installed PWAs handle links that use a specific protocol for a more integrated experience.

- **Quickly view Office files in the browser.** Users can now view Office files including documents, spreadsheets, and presentations that they come across while browsing on Microsoft Edge right in the browser without needing to download the file and then open it in a different application. There will be no changes in the file open experience for Office files that are hosted on OneDrive or SharePoint.
  
- **Freeform highlighting on PDFs.** The PDF viewing and markup experience are improved with the addition of freeform highlighters. You can highlight sections in PDFs that you don't have access to, and scanned documents.

- **Hardware-enforced Stack Protection.** Microsoft Edge begins supporting an even safer browsing mode that uses hardware-dependent control flow for browser processes on supported hardware (Intel 11th Gen. or AMD Zen 3). Note: Because this is a Controlled Feature Rollout, you might not notice this feature enabled on all devices. You can enable or disable Hardware-enforced Stack Protection by manipulating Image File Execution Options (IFEO) using group policy.

- **New warning dialog for typosquatting sites.** The browser shows a warning on some sites with URLs that look similar to other sites. This UI uses client-side heuristics to warn users about sites that might be spoofing popular web sites. For more information, see [What is typosquatting?](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/what-is-typosquatting-54a18872-8459-4d47-b3e3-d84d9a362eb0).
  
- **Dictionary added to mini-toolbar in Immersive Reader.**  We're adding dictionary functionality to the mini-toolbar to help your reading and research. You are able to look up the spelling and definitions of words more quickly and easily in the Immersive Reader experience.
  
- **Learn how to solve math problems with Math Solver.** We're excited to announce that you can use Math Solver in Microsoft Edge to get help with a wide range of mathematical concepts. These concepts range from elementary arithmetic and quadratic equations to trigonometry and calculus. Math Solver lets you take a picture of a handwritten or printed math problem and then provides an instant solution with step-by-step instructions to help you learn how to reach the solution without help. Math Solver also comes with a mathematical keyboard that you can use to easily type math problems. This keyboard eliminates the need to search around a traditional keyboard to find the math characters you need. After solving your problem, Math Solver provides options to continue learning with quizzes, worksheets, and video tutorials.

- **Split tunnel VPN support for WebRTC.** Allows enterprise customers to gain the benefit of VPN split tunneling for peer-to-peer traffic on Microsoft Edge. You can enable this feature using the [WebRtcRespectOsRoutingTableEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#webrtcrespectosroutingtableenabled) policy.

### Feature updates

- **View in File Explorer support for SharePoint Online libraries in Microsoft Edge.**  Now you can enable the View in File Explorer capability on SharePoint Online Modern Document Libraries. For this experience to be visible and work for your users, you need to enable the Microsoft Edge policy [Configure the View in File Explorer feature for SharePoint pages in Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#configureviewinfileexplorer) and update your SharePoint Online tenant configuration. Learn more: [View SharePoint files with File Explorer in Microsoft Edge](/SharePoint/sharepoint-view-in-edge).

- **Intranet zone file URL links will open in Windows File Explorer.**  You can allow file URL links to intranet zone files originating from intranet zone HTTPS websites to open Windows File Explorer for that file or directory. You can enable this experience using the [IntranetFileLinksEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#intranetfilelinksenabled) policy.

- **Improvements to the downloads experience.** Support for the download user experience is extended to progressive web applications PWAs and WebView. We'll also begin to support drag and drop to the File Explorer and Desktop.

- **Pick up where you left off on PDF documents.**  You'll now be able to resume reading from where you last closed your PDF document.

- **Efficiency mode extends battery life when your laptop enters battery saver mode.**  Efficiency mode becomes active when your laptop enters battery saver mode to allow the browser to manage resource usage to extend the battery life of your machine. You'll have four options when efficiency mode becomes active: Unplugged and low battery, Unplugged, Always, and Never. Note: This feature is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Free form text boxes added to PDF documents.** We now support adding free form text boxes to PDF documents. You can use these boxes to fill in forms and add visible notes.

- **Citation support added to Collections.**  We've improved the Collections experience, especially for students and researchers. Collections will start supporting citations and reading lists.

- **Update your passwords faster and with fewer clicks.** The browser will now take you directly to the Change Password page for a given website. This action saves you time and clicks by removing the need to navigate to the page manually. After you're on this page, the browser will also autofill your existing password and suggest a strong, unique new password.  Note: Currently this feature is only available on a limited number of sites.

- **Auto-account creation.** We now provide extra support on Sign-Up pages by allowing you to create an online account with one click. You can do this by selecting the suggestion drop-down when you click on any form field in the Sign-Up form. Doing so shows not only information relevant to the Sign-Up form, but also a strong new password suggestion. Upon selection, all the relevant information gets populated in the respective fields and the suggested password are automatically stored on submission to the website. Note: Currently this feature is only available on a limited number of sites.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge has completed the move to a 4-week cadence for updates.**  We have adopted a new 4-week release cycle for major versions. Read more here: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/03/12/new-release-cycles-microsoft-edge-extended-stable/

- **New Extended stable option being offered.**  We're offering a new Extended Stable option to our managed Enterprise customers. The Extended Stable option stays on even numbered revisions and update every eight weeks. There will be a biweekly security update.  Additional information here: https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/07/15/opt-in-extended-stable-release-cycle/

- **Improvements to default behavior of opening MHTML files.**  MHTML files continue to open in IE mode if IE mode is enabled, unless the MHTML file was saved from Microsoft Edge (using the Save As or Save Page As options in Microsoft Edge). If the file was saved from Microsoft Edge, it will now open in Microsoft Edge.  This change fixes a rendering issue that was observed when opening an MHTML file in IE mode when saved from Microsoft Edge.

- **Restrict private network requests to secure contexts.** Access to resources on local (intranet) networks from pages on the internet requires that those pages be delivered over HTTPS. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5436853517811712). Two compatibility policies are available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with non-secure pages: [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecureprivatenetworkrequestsallowed) and [InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestAllowedForUrls](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#insecureprivatenetworkrequestsallowedforurls).

- **Block mixed content downloads.** Secure pages will only download files hosted on other secure pages, and downloads hosted on non-secure (non-HTTPS) pages will be blocked if initiated from a secure page. This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Google security blog entry](https://security.googleblog.com/2020/02/protecting-users-from-insecure_6.html).

- **Enable implicit sign-in for on-premises accounts.** By enabling the [OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#onlyonpremisesimplicitsigninenabled) policy, only on-premises accounts will be enabled for implicit sign-in.  Microsoft Edge won't attempt to implicitly sign in to MSA or Microsoft Entra accounts. Upgrade from on-premises accounts to Microsoft Entra accounts will be stopped as well.

- **New accessibility settings page.**  We have brought accessibility-related settings together on a single page. You can find the new edge://settings/accessibility page under the main settings list. Here you can find settings to make the web page bigger, show a high visibility outline around the area of focus and other settings that can help improve your web browsing experience. We'll continue to add new settings here in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

***New Policies***

- [ApplicationGuardPassiveModeEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#applicationguardpassivemodeenabled) Ignore Application Guard site list configuration and browse Edge normally
- [OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#onlyonpremisesimplicitsigninenabled) Only on-premises account enabled for implicit sign-in
- [WebRtcRespectOsRoutingTableEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#webrtcrespectosroutingtableenabled) Enable support for Windows OS routing table rules when making peer to peer connections via WebRTC

***Obsoleted Policy***

- [UserAgentClientHintsEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#useragentclienthintsenabled) Enable the User-Agent Client Hints feature

### Feature updates

- **Initial Preferences in Microsoft Edge.**  Microsoft Edge now supports a limited number of Initial Preferences (formerly Master Preferences). IT admins can deploy these settings as default before the browser is run for the first time by their users. Additional information here: [Configure Microsoft Edge using Initial Preferences settings for the first run](/deployedge/initial-preferences-support-on-microsoft-edge-browser).

- **IE mode on Microsoft Edge will support "no-merge" behavior.**  For an end-user, when a new browser window is launched from an IE mode application, it is in a separate session, similar to the no-merge behavior in IE11. You'll need to adjust your site list to configure sites that need to prevent session sharing as "no-merge". Behind the scenes, for each window of Microsoft Edge, the first time an IE mode tab is visited within that window, if it's one of the designated "no-merge" sites, that window is locked into a different "no-merge" IE session from all other Microsoft Edge windows at least until the last IE mode tab is closed in that window. This follows previous behavior where users could launch IE with no-merge and could also launch Microsoft Edge without no-merge via other mechanisms.  Additional information here: [IE mode troubleshooting and FAQ | Microsoft Docs](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-faq#does-ie-mode-on-microsoft-edge-support-the--nomerge--option-that-was-supported-in-internet-explorer-11-)

- **New policy to stop implicit sign in.**  The [ImplicitSignInEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#implicitsigninenabled) policy allows system administrators to disable implicit sign-in on Microsoft Edge browsers.

- **Policies to bypass ClickOnce and DirectInvoke prompts.** We have updated our policies to enable bypassing ClickOnce's prompts and DirectInvoke's app for specified file types, from specified domains. To do this, you'll need to:

  - Enable [ClickOnceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#clickonceenabled) or [DirectInvokeEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#directinvokeenabled)
  - Enable [AutoOpenFileTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoopenfiletypes) policy and set the list of specific file types that ClickOnce and DirectInvoke should be disabled for
  - Enable the [AutoOpenAllowedForURLs](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoopenallowedforurls) policy and set the list of specific domains that ClickOnce and DirectInvoke will be disabled for.

  Note: AutoOpenAllowedForURLs is a supporter policy for AutoOpenFileTypes. If AutoOpenAllowedForURLs isn't set and AutoOpenFileTypes is set, then file types listed will automatically open from all URLs.

- **Tab Groups.**  We're turning on tab grouping that provides the ability to categorize tabs into user-defined groups and helps you more effectively find, switch, and manage tabs across multiple workstreams.  

- **Hide the title bar while using Vertical Tabs.**  Get the extra few pixels back by hiding the browser's title bar, while in Vertical Tabs. Now you can go to edge://settings/appearance and under the Customize Toolbar section select the option to hide the title bar while in Vertical Tab mode.

- **Video Picture in Picture (PiP) from hover toolbar.**  When you hover over a supported video, a toolbar appears that allows you to view that video in a PiP window.  Note: This is currently available for Microsoft Edge users on macOS.  

- **Removal of 3DES in TLS. Support for the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite will be removed.** This change is happening in the Chromium project, on which Microsoft Edge is based. For more information, navigate to the [Chrome Platform Status entry](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6678134168485888). Additionally, in Microsoft Edge version 93, the [TripleDESEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#tripledesenabled) policy is available to support scenarios that need to preserve compatibility with outdated servers. This compatibility policy becomes obsolete and stop working in Microsoft Edge version 95. Ensure that you update affected servers before then.

***New Policies***

- [AutoplayAllowlist](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoplayallowlist) Allow media autoplay on specific sites
- [CECPQ2Enabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#cecpq2enabled) CECPQ2 post-quantum key-agreement enabled for TLS

## Version 92.0.902.55: July 22

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#july-22-2021).

### Feature updates

- **Users can easily get to Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 92, users can reload a site in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of relying on the standalone IE 11 application while waiting for a site to be configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List. Users are prompted to add the site to their local site list such that navigating to the same page in Microsoft Edge will automatically render in IE mode for the next 30 days. You can use the [InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed) policy to configure this experience and allow access to the IE mode entry points and the ability to add sites to the local site list. You can use the [InternetExplorerIntegrationLocalSiteListExpirationDays](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationlocalsitelistexpirationdays) policy to adjust the number of days to keep sites on the local site list. KB5003698 or later is required for Windows 10, version 1909; or KB5003690 or later is required for Windows 10, version 2004, Windows 10, version 20H2, or Windows 10, version 21H1 for the end-to-end experience. For more information, see [Local site list in IE mode](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode-local-site-list).

- **MHTML files will default to opening in Internet Explorer mode**. Starting in Microsoft Edge version 92 Stable, MHTML file types will automatically open in Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge instead of the Internet Explorer (IE11) application. This is most commonly observed while trying to view Outlook emails in a browser. This change occurs only if IE11 is the default handler for this file type. If you'd prefer to change this, you can do so prior to installing the Stable version 92 update using [this guidance](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationdefaults#applicationdefaults-defaultassociationsconfiguration).

- **"Disable developer mode extensions" warning can be dismissed for 2 weeks**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you can snooze the warning "Disable developer mode extensions" for two weeks by selecting the option in the warning dialog dropdown.

- **Manage your extensions right from the toolbar**. The all-new extensions menu on the toolbar allows you to hide/pin extensions easily. The quick links to manage extensions and find new extensions make it easy for you to find new extensions and manage your existing ones.

- **Default for autoplay will be set to Limit**.  To help you maintain your focus online, we have changed the default for autoplaying media to Limit from Allow, beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92.

- **Payment instruments are now synced across devices**. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 92, you have the option to synchronize your payment information across your signed in devices. Note: This is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.
Currently this feature is available only in the US and only for MSA users (not Microsoft Entra ID)

- **Improvements to font rendering**. Improvements have been made to the rendering of text to improve clarity and reduce blurriness. Note: Tthis is a Controlled Feature Rollout. If you don't see this feature, check back shortly as we continue our rollout.

- **Toolbar button features like Favorites and Collections will remember the user's choice to pin them to the side of the window**. Now enabled by default, if the user chooses to pin a toolbar button, it will always open in the pinned state until they decide to unpin.
a
- **Users can now manage the 'Allow single sign-on for work or school sites using this profile' option via group policy**.  'Allow single sign-on for work or school sites using this profile' allows non-AAD profiles to be able to use single sign-on for work or school sites using work or school credentials present on the machine. This option shows up for end-users as a toggle in Settings -> Profiles -> Profile Preferences for non-AAD profiles only.  You can use the [AADWebSiteSSOUsingThisProfileEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#aadwebsitessousingthisprofileenabled) policy to configure the behavior.  

- **Password health**. It's important to use strong, unique passwords across different accounts to stay safe online. However, that's easier said than done and most users exhibit poor password habits like using weak passwords that are easy to guess, or reuse the same strong passwords across accounts.<br>

   With this latest version of Microsoft Edge, your task of using strong and unique passwords becomes slightly easier! Microsoft Edge will now tell you whether saved passwords are strong enough and also indicate whether they've been used across multiple sites, helping you stay safer online. You can find your password health information in your list of saved passwords in the edge://settings/passwords page.
  
- **Added privacy for your saved passwords**. If you're using a device you share with others or have left your computer unlocked for whatever reason, you can now opt for a second verification using your device password to avoid others getting access to your website passwords. Simple!

- **Outlook extension**.  Stay on top of your Microsoft Outlook inbox, calendar, tasks, and more without having to open a new browser window.  You can get the new Outlook extension here: [Microsoft Outlook - Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/microsoft-outlook/kkpalkknhlklpbflpcpkepmmbnmfailf?hl=en-US)

- **In alignment with the Chromium open source project, Microsoft Edge is updating the way it renders tables on web pages**. This change fixes known issues and brings Microsoft Edge closer to the specified way tables are meant to render across the web/other browsers. We recommend that you test important workflows in your environment for unexpected issues. A full explainer is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16PFD1GtMI9Zgwu0jtPaKZJ75Q2wyZ9EZnVbBacOfiNA/edit).

- **Microsoft Editor.**  Microsoft Editor offers enhanced spell checking, grammar checking, and text predictions. [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/microsoft-editor-checks-grammar-and-more-in-documents-mail-and-the-web-91ecbe1b-d021-4e9e-a82e-abc4cd7163d7).

### Feature updates

- **Identify network traffic originating from Microsoft Defender Application Guard containers at the proxy level**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, there's built in support to tag network traffic originating from Application Guard containers, allowing enterprises to identify them and apply specific policies.

- **Support option to allow synchronizing Favorites from the host to the Edge Application Guard container**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, users have the option to configure Application Guard to synchronize their favorites from the host to the container. This ensures new favorites appear on the container as well.

- **Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91 the browser will automatically interrupt downloads of types which could harm your computer if those downloads are started without a user interaction and are not supported by SmartScreen Application Reputation check**. Users may override and continue to download by right clicking and choosing "Keep" on the download item. Enterprise administrators may opt out of this behavior by configuring the following policy:
  - [ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptdomainfiletypepairsfromfiletypedownloadwarnings.md) - Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains

    For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Security downloads interruptions](microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions.md).

- **Support for Speech Recognition APIs**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91, API support for speech recognition commands on Google.com and similar sites are added. This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

- **Personalize your browser with new theme colors**. Make Microsoft Edge your own with one of the 14 new theme colors on the Settings -> Appearance page. You can also install custom themes from the Microsoft Edge Add-on site. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/make-microsoft-edge-your-own-with-themes/m-p/2083165)

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#april-15-2021).

## Feature updates ##

- **Single Sign On (SSO) is now available for Microsoft Entra accounts and Microsoft Account (MSA) on macOS.** A user signed in on Microsoft Edge on macOS will now get automatically signed into websites that are configured to allow single sign-on with Work and Microsoft accounts (for example, bing.com, office.com, msn.com, and outlook.com).

- **Kiosk mode.** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, we have locked down the UI print settings to only allow the configured printers and "Print to PDF" options. We have also done improvements within the assigned access single app kiosk mode to restrict the launch of other applications from the browser. For more information about the kiosk mode features go [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode#kiosk-mode-supported-features).

- **Interrupt Downloads** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 91 the browser will automatically interrupt downloads of types that could harm your computer if those downloads are started without a user interaction and aren't supported by SmartScreen Application Reputation check. Users may override and continue to download by right clicking and choosing "Keep" on the download item.
Enterprise administrators may opt out of this behavior one of these two policies:
- [ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptdomainfiletypepairsfromfiletypedownloadwarnings) - Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains
For more information, see [Microsoft Edge Security downloads interruptions](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-downloads-interruptions)

- **Printing**:

  - **New print rasterization mode for non-PostScript printers.** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, Admins can use a new policy to define print rasterization mode for their users. This policy controls how Microsoft Edge prints to non-PostScript printers on Windows. Sometimes print jobs on non-PostScript printers need to be rasterized to print correctly. The print options are Full and Fast.
    
  - **Additional page scaling options for printing.** Users are now able to customize scaling while printing webpages and PDF documents using more options. The "Fit to Page" option ensures that the webpage or document is fit into the space available in the selected "Paper size" for printing. The "Actual size" option ensures that there are no changes in the size of the contents being printed regardless of the selected "Paper size".

- **Productivity:**

  - **Autofill suggestions are extended to include address fields content from clipboard.** Clipboard content is parsed when you click on a profile/address field (for example, phone, email, zip code, city, state, etc.) to show as autofill suggestions.

  - **Users can search for autofill suggestions even if a form or field isn't detected.** Today if you have your information saved on Microsoft Edge, autofill suggestions pop up automatically and help you save time while filling out forms. In cases where autofill misses a form, or if you want to fetch data in forms that don't typically have autofill (like temporary forms), you can search for your information use autofill.

-  **Access downloads from a flyout in the menu bar.** Downloads appear in the top-right corner with all the active downloads in one place. This menu is easily dismissible so users can continue browsing uninterrupted, and they can monitor overall download progress right from the toolbar. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-the-new-downloads-experience/m-p/2111551).

- **Improvements to font rendering.** Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90, we made improvements to the rendering of text to improve clarity and reduce blurriness. Part of the font rendering improvements land in Beta version 90 but are disabled by default.

- **Kids mode.** We've updated the policy so that when the policy is enabled, it disables the Kid Mode feature in addition to family safety. More about Kids Mode [here](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/learn-more-about-kids-mode-in-microsoft-edge-4bf0273c-1cbd-47a9-a8f3-895bc1f95bdd)

### Resolved issues

- **Taskbar and Start menu shortcut updates and fixes:**
  - Right-clicking the Microsoft Edge shortcut in the Start menu now properly shows the option to unpin Microsoft Edge from the taskbar when it's pinned.
  - Start layouts that include a [taskbar configuration](/windows/configuration/configure-windows-10-taskbar) to pin Microsoft Edge to the taskbar will no longer result in a second Microsoft Edge shortcut getting pinned to the taskbar.
  - Organizations using Windows Roaming Profiles will no longer see a blank white icon in place of the Microsoft Edge icon on the taskbar when their users sign in Windows.

### Feature updates

- **Kiosk mode enables additional lockdown capabilities**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, we have added more lockdown capabilities within kiosk mode to enable customers to get the job done in a productive and more secure experience. [Learn more](microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode.md#kiosk-mode-supported-features).

- **The Enterprise Mode Site List Manager tool will be available in the browser through the *edge://compat* page**. You can use this tool to create, edit, and export your site list XML for Internet Explorer mode on Microsoft Edge. You can enable access to this tool as needed through group policy. [Learn More](./edge-ie-mode-site-list-manager.md).

- **Improve browser performance with sleeping tabs**. Sleeping tabs improves browser performance by putting inactive tabs to sleep to free up system resources like memory and CPU so active tabs or other applications can use them. Users can prevent sites from going to sleep and configure the length of time before an inactive tab goes to sleep. To keep users in their flow, there are also [heuristics](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/sleeping-tabs-faq/m-p/1705434) to prevent certain sites from going to sleep, such as intranet sites. This feature can be managed with group policies.

- **Reset your Microsoft Edge sync data in the cloud manually**. We're introducing a way to reset your Microsoft Edge sync data from within the product. This ensures that your data is cleared from Microsoft services, and resolving certain product issues that previously required a support ticket.

- **Intelligent enablement of Single sign-on (SSO) for all Windows Microsoft Entra accounts for users with a single non-Azure AD Microsoft Edge profile**.  Automatically turn on this setting for users that might benefit the most from this feature. If a user has only one Microsoft Edge profile (and it's not Microsoft Entra ID or Kids Mode), the setting is automatically turned on when Microsoft Edge launches. This autotoggle will also automatically turn off if a user later chooses to sign into a different Microsoft Edge profile with a Microsoft Entra account. Users can manually update their preferences for this feature in **Settings > Profiles >Profile Preferences > Allow single sign-on for work or school sites using this profile**.

- **Improvements to text selection experience within PDF documents**. Users begin to get a smoother and more consistent text selection experience across PDF documents opened in Microsoft Edge starting with version 89.

- **Date of birth field now supported in autofill**. Today Microsoft Edge helps you save time and effort while filling out forms and creating accounts online by auto filling your data like addresses, names, phone numbers, etc. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 89, we're adding support for another field that you can have saved and autofilled - date of birth. You can view, edit, and delete this information anytime in your profile settings.

### Feature updates

- **Deprecations:**

  - Deprecate support for FTP protocol. Support for the legacy FTP protocol has been removed from Microsoft Edge. Attempting to navigate to an FTP link results in the browser directing the Operating System to open an external application to handle the FTP link. Alternatively, IT administrators can configure Microsoft Edge to use IE Mode for sites that rely on the FTP protocol.
  - Adobe Flash support is removed. Starting with Microsoft Edge Beta version 88, Adobe Flash capability and support will be removed. Learn more: [Update on Adobe Flash Player End of Support - Microsoft Edge Blog (windows.com)](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/04/update-adobe-flash-end-support/)

- **Authentication:**

  - Single Sign On (SSO) now available for Microsoft Entra accounts and Microsoft Account (MSA) on down-level Windows. A user signed in on Microsoft Edge on down-level Microsoft Windows (7, 8.1) will now get automatically signed into websites that are configured to allow single sign-on with Work and Microsoft accounts (for example, bing.com, office.com, msn.com, outlook.com).<br>Note: A user may have to sign out and then sign back in if they'd signed into Microsoft Edge in a version prior to Microsoft Edge 88 to leverage this feature.
  
  - Single sign-on (SSO) to work sites using any Windows Microsoft Entra accounts on system in non-Azure AD Microsoft Edge profiles. This feature can be enabled for any profile that isn't signed-in with a work/school account and isn't guest or in-private and allows the use of any signed-in work/school account on operating system with that profile. This feature can be configured in **Settings** > **Profiles** > **Profile Preferences** > **Allow single sign-on for work or school sites using this profile**.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > "Single sign-on (SSO) for all Windows accounts using the Microsoft Edge profile" is an update to the January 21 release notes.

- **Kiosk mode option to end session**. The "End session" button is now available in a kiosk mode public browsing experience. This feature ensures that browser data and settings are deleted when Microsoft Edge is closed. Learn more about kiosk mode features and roadmap, [Configure Microsoft Edge kiosk mode](./microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode.md).

- **Security and Privacy:**

  - Alerts are generated if a user's password is found in an online leak. User passwords are checked against a repository of known-breached credentials and send the user an alert if a match is found. To ensure security and privacy, user passwords are hashed and encrypted when they're checked against the database of leaked credentials.
  - Automatically upgrade mixed content. Secure pages delivered over HTTPS may contain references images that are served over non-secure HTTP. To improve privacy and security in Microsoft Edge 88, those images will be retrieved over HTTPS instead. If the image is not available over HTTPS, it will not be loaded.
  - View site permissions by site and by recent activity. Starting with Microsoft Edge 88, users are able to manage site permissions more easily. They'll be able to view permissions by web site rather than just permission type. Additionally, we've added a recent activity section that shows a user all the recent changes to their site permissions.
  - Increased controls for browser cookies. Starting with Microsoft Edge 88, users can delete third party cookies without affecting first party cookies. Users will also be able to filter their cookies by first or third party and sort by name, number of cookies, and the amount of data stored and last modified.

- **Passwords:**

  - Password Generator. Microsoft Edge offers a built-in strong password generator that you can use when signing up for a new account or when changing an existing password. Just look for the browser-suggested password drop-down in the password field and when selected, it will automatically save to the browser and sync across devices for easy future use.
  - Password Monitor. When any of your passwords saved to the browser match with those seen in the list of leaked credentials, Microsoft Edge notifies you and prompt you to update your password. Password Monitor scans for matches on your behalf and is on by default.
  - Edit Password. You can now edit your saved passwords directly in Microsoft Edge Settings. Any time a password has been updated outside of Microsoft Edge, it's easy to replace the saved older password with the new one by editing the saved entry in Settings. 

- **Improve Microsoft Edge startup speed with startup boost**. To improve Microsoft Edge startup speed, we've developed a feature named startup boost. Startup boost makes Microsoft Edge launch faster by enabling Microsoft Edge to run in the background. Note: This feature is limited to a randomly selected group of users who have enabled experimentation. These users are giving feedback to the feature team.

- **Productivity:**

  - Improve productivity and multi-tasking with vertical tabs. As the number of horizontal tabs grows, site titles start to get cut off and tab controls are lost as each tab shrinks. This interrupts user workflow as they spend more time finding, switching, and managing their tabs and less time on the task at hand. Vertical tabs let users move their tabs to the side, where vertically aligned icons and longer site titles make it easier to quickly scan, identify and switch to the tab they want to open.
  - Auto filling the date of birth field. Microsoft Edge already helps save time and effort while filling out forms and creating accounts online by auto filling user data such as addresses, names, phone numbers, etc. Microsoft Edge now supports the date of birth field which users can save and auto fill. A user can view, edit, and delete this information anytime in their profile settings.
  - Improvements to Recently closed in History. Recently closed now keeps the last 25 tabs and windows from any past browsing session rather than just the previous session. Users can select Recently closed in the new History experience to see all the tabs that were open.
  - "Your day at a glance" feature enabled by default. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 88, information workers can benefit from intelligent productivity features on their New tab page (NTP). Microsoft Edge 87 users will also experience these features within two weeks after Microsoft Edge 88 release. We offer users signed in with their work or school account personalized and relevant content powered by their M365 Graph. Users can quickly scan their "Your day at a glance" modules to easily track their meetings and recent work and quickly launch the applications they want to use.

- **History and open tabs sync**. History and open tabs sync is now available for users to enjoy. Enabling these features help users pick up where they left off by making their browsing history and open tabs available on all their syncing devices. We've updated sync and browser history policies, so now users are connected and productive across any devices by using Microsoft Edge. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/01/21/this-year-lets-resolve-to-make-the-most-of-our-time-online-and-better-protect-ourselves-from-online-threats/).

- **PDF:**

  - PDF document display in book view (two pages). Starting with Microsoft Edge version 88, users can view PDF documents in a single page or in the two page book view. To change the view, click the **Page View** button in the toolbar.
  - Anchored text notes support for PDF files. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 87, users can add typed text notes on any piece of text in PDF files.

- **Fonts:**

  - Browser icons are updated to the Fluent design system. As part of our continued work around Fluent Design in the browser, we've made changes to closer align icons to the new Microsoft icon system. These changes impact many of our high-touch user interfaces, including tabs, address bar, and navigational and wayfinding icons found in our various menus.
  - Improved font rendering. Text rendering is improved for better clarity and to reduce blurriness.

Learn more about how to [Configure Microsoft Edge kiosk mode](./microsoft-edge-configure-kiosk-mode.md)

- **Shopping features enabled by default**. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 87 enterprise users can also benefit from shopping in Edge. With Shopping features, Microsoft Edge helps users to find coupons and better prices while shopping online. Coupon experience is available with this update and price comparison will be released in upcoming updates for Microsoft Edge 87. This feature can be configured through [EdgeShoppingAssistantEnabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#edgeshoppingassistantenabled) policy. See our [Blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/11/19/finish-up-that-holiday-shopping-with-new-features-from-microsoft-edge-and-bing/) and [Learn More](/microsoft-edge/privacy-whitepaper#shopping) about Microsoft Shopping.

- **ClickOnce deployment enabled by default**. ClickOnce is enabled by default in Microsoft Edge 87, which reduces the barriers for enterprises to deploy software and better align with Microsoft Edge Legacy browser behavior. Starting in Microsoft Edge 87, the ClickOnceEnabled policy's "Not configured" state reflects the new default ClickOnce state of Enabled (as compared to the previous default state of Disabled).

- **The enterprise new tab page (NTP) integrates productivity with customizable, work-relevant feed content**.

In addition, they can easily customize "My Feed" by choosing the most relevant content to them from the available content and modules for their organization. IT Administrators can control the News feed settings for their  organization, including the selected industry for the Microsoft Edge new tab page by going to Microsoft 365 admin center. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/29/enterprise-new-tab-page-my-feed/)

- **Privacy and Security:**

  - Support TLS Token Binding for policy-configured sites. TLS Token binding helps prevent token theft attacks to ensure that cookies can't be reused from a device other than the device upon which they were initially set. The use of TLS token binding requires setting the [AllowTokenBindingForUrls](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#allowtokenbindingforurls) policy and requires that the sites listed support this feature.

- **Keyboard support for highlighter on PDF files**. Users can use their keyboard keys to highlight any text on a PDF.

- **Printing:**

  - Choose which side to flip on when printing on both sides. Users can choose to flip on the long side or the short side of a sheet when printing on both sides.
  - Choose print rasterization mode for the enterprise. Control how Microsoft Edge prints to a non-PostScript printer on Windows. Sometimes print jobs on non-PostScript printers need to be rasterized to print correctly. The print options are "Full" and "Fast".

Security updates are listed [here](./microsoft-edge-relnotes-security.md#october-9-2020)

### Feature updates

* **Roll back to previous Microsoft Edge version.** The rollback feature lets administrators revert to a known good version of Microsoft Edge if there's an issue in the latest version of Microsoft Edge. **Note:** Stable version 86.0.622.38 is the first version you can roll back to, which means that Stable version 87 is the first version ready to roll back from. [Learn more](edge-learnmore-rollback.md).

* **Enforce enabling Sync by default across the enterprise.**  Administrators can enable synchronization for Microsoft Entra accounts by default with the [ForceSync](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#forcesync) policy.

* **Automatic profile switching on Windows 7 and 8.1.** The automatic profile switching currently available in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 is extended to downlevel Windows (Windows 7 and 8.1). For more information, see the [automatic profile switching](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/04/30/automatic-profile-switching/) blog post.

* **SameSite=Lax Cookies By Default**. To improve web security and privacy, cookies will now default to [SameSite=Lax](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) handling by default. This means that cookies will only be sent in a first-party context and will be omitted for requests sent to third-parties. This change can cause compatibility impact on websites that require cookies for third-party resources to function correctly. To permit such cookies, web developers can mark cookies, which should be set from and sent to third-party contexts by adding explicit `SameSite=none` and `Secure` attributes when the cookie is set. Enterprises that wish to exempt certain sites from this change can do so using the [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabledfordomainlist) policy, or can opt out of the change across all sites using the [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabled) policy.

* **Remove the HTML5 Application Cache API.**  Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86, the legacy Application Cache API that enables offline use of web pages is being removed from Microsoft Edge. Web Developers should review the [WebDev documentation](https://web.dev/appcache-removal/) for information on replacing  the Application Cache API with Service Workers.  Important: You can request an [AppCache OriginTrial Token](https://developers.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/1776670052997660673) that allows sites to continue to use the deprecated Application Cache API until Microsoft Edge version 90.

* **Privacy and Security:**

  * Replace [MetricsReportingEnabled](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#metricsreportingenabled) and [SendSiteInformationToImproveServices](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#sendsiteinfotoimproveservices) policies for downlevel Windows and macOS. These policies are deprecated in Microsoft Edge version 86 and will become obsolete in Microsoft Edge version 89.<br>
These policies are replaced by [Allow Telemetry](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization) on Windows 10, and the new [DiagnosticData](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#diagnosticdata) policy for all other platforms. This lets users manage the diagnostic data that gets sent to Microsoft for Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and macOS.
  * Secure DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS) support.  Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86, settings to control Secure DNS on unmanaged devices is available. These settings aren't accessible to users on managed devices, but IT admins can enable or disable Secure DNS using the [dnsoverhttpsmode](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#dnsoverhttpsmode) group policy.

* **Internet Explorer mode:** Let users use the Microsoft Edge User Interface (UI) to test sites in Internet Explorer mode. Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86, administrators can enable a UI option for their users to load a tab in Internet Explorer mode for testing purposes or as a stopgap until sites are added to the site list XML.

* **PDF updates:**

  * Table of contents for PDF Documents. Beginning with version 86, Microsoft Edge has added support for table of contents that lets users easily navigate through PDF documents.
  * Access all PDF functionalities on small form factor screens. Access all the capabilities of the Microsoft Edge PDF reader on devices with small screen sizes.
  * Pen support for highlighter on PDF files. With this update, users can use their digital pen to directly highlight text on PDF files, in the same way they would with a physical highlighter and paper.
  * Improved PDF scrolling. You'll now be able to experience stutter free scrolling while navigating through long PDF documents.

* **Users will see auto complete suggestions when they start typing a search query on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.** Auto complete will help users quickly complete their search query without having to type the entire string. This is helpful because users won't have to remember correct spellings and they can choose from the available options that are displayed.

* **Add a custom image to the New Tab Page (NTP) using a group policy.** Beginning with Microsoft Edge version 86 the NTP has an option to replace the default image with a custom user-supplied image. The ability to manage the properties of this image is also supported by the group policy.

* **Match customized keyboard shortcuts to VS Code.** Microsoft Edge DevTools now supports customizing keyboard shortcuts in the DevTools to match with your editor/IDE. (In Microsoft Edge 84, we added the ability to match DevTools keyboard shortcuts to VS Code).

* **Delete downloads from disk using download manager.** Users are now able to delete their downloaded files from their disk without leaving the browser. The new Delete downloads functionality exists within the context menu of downloads shelf or the downloads page.

### Feature updates

- **On-premises synchronization of Favorites and Settings**. Now you can synchronize browser favorites and settings between Active Directory profiles within your own environment without the need for cloud sync.

- **Microsoft Edge group policy support for trusting site + app combos to launch without a confirmation prompt.**. Group policy support added that lets administrators add site + app combos that are trusted to launch without the confirmation prompt. This adds the ability for administrators to configure trusted protocol/origin combinations (such as Microsoft 365 apps) for their end-users to suppress the confirmation prompt when navigating to a URL that contains an app protocol.

- **PDF Highlighter tool**. This tool can be added to the toolbar for PDFs to easily highlight important text.

- **The Storage Access API is available**. The Storage Access API allows access to first-party storage in a third-party context when a user has provided a direct intent to allow storage that would otherwise be blocked by the browser's current configuration. For more information, see [Storage Access API](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5612590694662144).

- **Send to OneNote is available for Microsoft Edge Collections**. Everyone's excited to be able to send the information they've gathered in Collections to OneNote, where they can append it to a larger project and collaborate with others! And even more importantly, in Microsoft Edge 85, you are able send content to *Office for Mac* products (Word, Excel, and OneNote) for both Microsoft account and Microsoft Entra ID.

- **DevTools updates**. For details about the following updates, see [What's New In DevTools (Microsoft Edge 85)](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2020/06/devtools).

   - Microsoft Edge DevTools supports Surface Duo emulation. The Microsoft Edge DevTools can emulate the Surface Duo so you can test how your web content looks on dual-screen devices. To turn on this experiment in DevTools, enter Device Mode by pressing Ctrl+Shift+M on Windows or Command+Shift+M on macOS, and then select Surface Duo from the device drop-down list.
   - Microsoft Edge DevTools lets you match keyboard shortcuts to VS Code. The Microsoft Edge DevTools supports customizing keyboard shortcuts in the DevTools to match your editor/IDE. In Microsoft Edge 85, we're adding the ability to match DevTools keyboard shortcuts to VS Code. This change helps increase productively across VS Code and DevTools.

### Feature updates

- This version of Microsoft Edge provides improved site list download times for Internet Explorer mode. We've reduced download delay for the Internet Explorer mode site list to 0 seconds (down from a 60-second wait) in the absence of a cached site list. We've also added group policy support for cases when Internet Explorer mode home page navigation need to be delayed until the site list is downloaded. For more information, see the [DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#delaynavigationsforinitialsitelistdownload) policy.

- Microsoft Edge now allows users to sign-into the browser when it's "run as administrator" on Windows 10. This helps customers running Microsoft Edge on Windows server or in remote-desktop and sandbox scenarios.

- Microsoft Edge now provides full mouse support when in full screen mode. Now you can use your mouse to access tabs, the address bar, and other items without having to exit full screen mode.

- Online purchase improvement. Add custom nicknames to saved debit or credit cards. Now you can distinguish and differentiate your credit cards when making online purchases. Nicknaming your debit or credit cards lets you choose the correct card when using autofill to select a payment method.

- TLS/1.0 and TLS/1.1 are disabled by default.  The [SSLVersionMin](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#sslversionmin) policy permits re-enabling of TLS/1.0 and TLS/1.1. This policy remains available until at least Microsoft Edge version 88. For more information, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

- Collections improvements:

  - A note capability is added that lets you add a note or comment to an item in a collection. Notes are grouped together and stay attached to an item even if you sort the items in a collection. To try this new feature, right-click on an item and select "Add note".
  - You can change the background color of notes in collections. You can use color coding to help you organize information and increase productivity.
  - There are noticeable performance improvements, which let you export your collections to  Excel in less time than in previous versions of Microsoft Edge.

- Extra Microsoft Edge API support:

  - The Storage Access API is enabled for experimentation. This feature is enabled for home users and Enterprise users with the [ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#experimentationandconfigurationservicecontrol) policy set to "Full". This feature is enabled by default for all users in Microsoft Edge Stable Channel version 85.
  
    As privacy is becoming increasingly important to users, requests for stricter browser defaults and user opt-in settings like blocking all third-party storage access are increasingly common. While these settings help improve privacy and block unwanted access by unknown or untrusted parties, they can have unwanted side effects such as blocking access to content the user may want to view (for example, social media and embedded media content.)

    The Storage Access API allows access to first-party storage in a third-party context when a user provides a direct intent to allow storage that would otherwise be blocked by the browser's current configuration. For more information, see [Storage Access API](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5612590694662144).

  - The Native File System API, which means you can give sites permissions to edit files or folders via the Native File System API.

- PDF improvements:

  - Read Aloud for PDF lets users listen to PDF content while carrying out other tasks that may be important for them. It also helps audio visual learners focus on reading the content, making learning easier.
  - PDF file editing is improved. Now you can save an edit made to a PDF back to the file instead of saving a copy each time you edit the PDF.

- Microsoft Edge now enables Translation in the Immersive Reader. When a user opens the Immersive Reader view, they get the option to translate the page to their desired language.

- Several DevTools updates, including support for customizing keyboard shortcuts to match VS Code and viewing the DevTools in high contrast.  For more information, see [What's New In DevTools (Microsoft Edge 84)](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2020/05/devtools).

### Policy updates

#### New policies

### Feature updates

- Microsoft Edge updates will now roll out gradually. Going forward, updates for Microsoft Edge will be rolled out to our users over a period of a few days. This enables us to protect more of you from accidental buggy updates, which improves your update experience. As a user you'll continue to get seamless auto-updates. If your organization isn't enrolled for auto-updates, you won't be affected by this change. To learn more, see the [progressive rollouts article](microsoft-edge-update-progressive-rollout.md).
- Microsoft Defender SmartScreen improvements: Made several improvements to the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen service, such as improved protection from malicious sites that redirect when loading, and top-level frame blocking, which completely replaces malicious sites with the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen safety page. The top-level frame blocking prevents audio and other media from the malicious site from playing which gives an easier and less confusing experience.

- In response to user feedback, users can now exempt certain cookies from automatically clearing when the browser closes. This option is helpful if there's a site that users don't want to be signed out of, but still want to have all the other cookies cleared when the browser closes. To use this feature, go to *edge://settings/clearBrowsingDataOnClose* and enable the "Cookies and other site data" toggle.

- Automatic Profile Switching is now available to help you get to your work content more easily across profiles. If you use multiple profiles at work, you can check it out by navigating to a site requiring authentication from your work or school account while on your personal profile. When we detect this, you'll receive a prompt to switch to your work profile to access that site without having to authenticate to it. When you choose the work profile you want to switch to, the website will open in your work profile. This profile switching capability helps you keep your work and personal data separate and help you get to your work content more effortlessly. If you don't want the feature to prompt you to switch profiles, you can choose the don't ask me again option and it gets out of your way.

- Collections feature improvements:
  - You can use drag and drop to add an item to a collection without opening the collection. During the drag and drop you can also choose a location in the collection list where you want to put the item.
  - You can add multiple items to a collection instead of adding one item at a time. To add multiple items, select the items and then drag them to a collection. Or you can select the items, right-click and then pick the collection where you want the items.

- You can add all the tabs in an Microsoft Edge window into a new collection without adding them individually. To do this action, right-click on any tab and choose "Add all tabs to a new collection".

- Extension sync is now available. You can now sync your extensions across all your devices! Extensions from both the Microsoft and Chrome Stores sync with Microsoft Edge. To use this feature: Click the ellipses (**…**) on the menu bar, select **Settings**. Under Your profile, click **Sync** to see the Sync options. Under **Profiles/Sync** use the toggle to enable Extensions. You can use the [SyncTypesListDisabled](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#synctypeslistdisabled) group policy to disable syncing of extensions.

- Improved the message on the Downloads management page for insecure downloads that have been blocked.

- Immersive Reader improvements:
  - Added support for Adverbs in the Parts of Speech experience we have in Immersive Reader. While reading an article within the Immersive Reader, open the Grammar Tools and switch on Adverbs within Parts of Speech to highlight all the adverbs on the page.
  - Added the ability to select any content on a webpage and open it in Immersive Reader. This ability enables users to use the Immersive Reader and all the Learning Tools, such as Line Focus and Read Aloud, across all websites.

- Link doctor provides host correction and a search query to the users when they mistype a URL. For example: <br>
A user mistypes "powerbi" as "powerbbi".com. Link doctor suggests "powerbi".com as a correction and create a link to search for "powerbbi" in case the user is looking for something different.

- Allow users to save their decision to launch an external protocol for a specific site. Users can configure the [ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox](/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#externalprotocoldialogshowalwaysopencheckbox) policy to enable or disable this feature.

- Users can set Microsoft Edge as their default browser directly from Microsoft Edge **Settings**. This makes it easier for users to change their default browser, within the context of the browser itself, instead of having to search through the operating system settings. To use this feature, go to *edge://settings/defaultBrowser* and click **Make default**.

- Several DevTools updates, including new remote debugging support, UI improvements, and more. For more information, see [What's New In DevTools (Microsoft Edge 83)](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2020/03/devtools).

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps warn scenario is now available. This enables admins to set up warn, a new category of Defender for Cloud Apps blocks, where the user can override a Defender for Cloud Apps block page. MDATP E5 blocks are natively integrated with SmartScreen blocks in Microsoft Edge for a seamless experience. This experience allows for a full page red block with the message "This website is blocked by your organization", instead of just a toast notification.

- Disallow synchronous XmlHttpRequest in page dismissal. Sending of synchronous XmlHttpRequests during unload of a webpage will be removed. This change improves browser performance and reliability, but may impact web applications that haven't yet been updated to use more modern web APIs, including sendBeacon and fetch. The Group Policy to disable this change and permit synchronous XHR during page dismissal will be available until Microsoft Edge 88. For more information, see [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes).

### Feature updates

- Added support for Windows Information Protection (WIP), which helps enterprises protect sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure. [Learn More](./microsoft-edge-security-windows-information-protection.md).

- Collections are now available. To get started, select the Collections icon next to the address bar. This action opens the Collections pane where you can create, edit, and view Collections. We designed Collections based on what you do on the web. If you're a shopper, a traveler, a teacher, or a student, Collections can help. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2019/12/09/improvements-collections-sync-microsoft-edge/#LuDPRDUDCgdgdOVt.97).

- Allow the removal (Hide from toolbar) of the Collections button from the Microsoft Edge toolbar for consistency.

- On-premises Active Directory account auto sign in will only be targeted to organizations that turn it on.  If users were already signed in with an on-premises AD account, they'll be able to sign out of it. Users will only be automatically signed in with the primary account on their operating system if it's a Microsoft account or a Microsoft Entra account. Admins can enable auto sign in with an on-premises AD account using the ConfigureOnPremisesAccountAutoSignIn policy.

- Application Guard. Extensions support now available in the container.

- Added a message to inform users that Internet Explorer isn't installed when they navigate to a page that's configured to open in Internet Explorer mode.

- Updated the 3D View tool in Microsoft Edge DevTools with a new feature to help debug z-index stacking context. 3D View shows a representation of the DOM (Document Object Model) depth using color and stacking, and the z-Index view helps you isolate the different stacking contexts of your page. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/01/23/debug-z-index-3d-view-edge-devtools/).

- The F12 Dev tools are localized in 10 new languages, so they'll match the language used in the rest of the browser. [Learn more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/02/04/localizing-edge-devtools/).

- Added support for Dolby Vision playback. On Dolby Vision-enabled Windows 10 Build 17134 (April 2018 Update), websites can show Dolby vision content. See how to enable Dolby Vision content from [Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/42384).

- Microsoft Edge can now identify and remove duplicate favorites and merge folders with the same name. To access the tool, select the star on the browser's toolbar and select "Remove duplicate favorites".  You can that confirm changes and any updates to your favorites will be synced across devices.

- We heard from users it can be difficult to distinguish a normal browsing window in dark theme from an InPrivate window since both window frames are dark. The new solid InPrivate blue pill in the top right corner helps reassure users they're browsing InPrivate.

- Open external links in the correct browser profile. Select a default profile for links opened for external apps to open in from *edge://settings/multiProfileSettings*.

- Added a warning that alerts users who sign into a browser profile with an account after being previously signed in with another account. This warning helps prevent unintentional data merging.

- If you have payment cards saved in your Microsoft account, you can use them in Microsoft Edge while filling out payment forms. The cards in your Microsoft account will sync across desktop devices and the full details will be shared with the website after two-factor authentication (CVC code and your Microsoft identity.) For further convenience, you can choose to securely save a copy of the card on the device during authentication.

- Line Focus is designed for users who like to focus on a limited part of the content as they read. It lets users keep the focus on one, three, or five lines at a time and dims out the rest of the page to let users read without distraction. Users can scroll using touch or arrow keys and the focus shifts accordingly.

- Microsoft Edge is now integrated with Windows Speller on Windows platforms 8.1 and above. This integration provides greater language support, with access to more language dictionaries and the ability to use Windows custom dictionaries. There's no further action needed from the users when a language is added in the OS language settings. Also, a language spellcheck toggle is enabled in Microsoft Edge settings.

- When PDF documents are opened using Microsoft Edge, users will now be able to create highlights, change color, and delete highlights. This feature helps in referencing important parts of the document later, and for collaboration.

- When loading long PDF documents that have been optimized for web, the pages being viewed by the user will be loaded faster, parallelly, while the rest of the document is loading.

- Now it's easier to start the Immersive Reader for a website by just pressing the F9 key.

- Now it's easier to start Read Aloud by using a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + U).

- Added an MSI command line parameter that lets you suppress Desktop icon creation when you install Microsoft Edge. The following example shows how to use this new parameter: <br>
`MicrosoftEdgeEnterpriseX64.msi DONOTCREATEDESKTOPSHORTCUT=true`<br>
There will be a group policy to support this functionality in an upcoming release.
